REPAIR DETAILS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repair 1:
  Turns: [2, 3]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner's inappropriate greeting
  Evidence: The learner responds with an inappropriate 'Bye, Daniels' to the bot's introduction and question. The bot implicitly corrects this by starting its next turn with 'Hi there!' and re-prompting the original question, which the learner accepts by continuing the task.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 2 (learner): “Bye, Daniels.”...
    Turn 3 (bot): Hi there! All right, let’s get started. So just let me know roughly when you realized your wallet we...


Repair 2:
  Turns: [16, 17, 18]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: pronunciation/ASR – misrecognition of learner's description
  Evidence: The learner attempts to describe the wallet using unclear phrases like 'high-fired Heliosphere, the brain's Heliosphere'. The bot interprets this as 'Tommy Hilfiger wallet' and the learner accepts this interpretation by saying 'OK' and moving on.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 16 (learner): “Okay, I have more details. This wallet is black, it's the high-fired Heliosphere, the brain's Helio...
    Turn 17 (bot): Perfect, that’s really helpful. So a black Tommy Hilfiger wallet with a blue outline detail—got it. ...
    Turn 18 (learner): “OK. I will try.”...


Repair 3:
  Turns: [20, 21, 22]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: lack of understanding – learner didn't catch bot's previous utterance
  Evidence: The learner explicitly asks 'Could you repeat, please?', indicating they did not understand the bot's previous turn. The bot repeats its message, and the learner confirms understanding with 'OK'.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 20 (learner): “Could you repeat, please?”...
    Turn 21 (bot): Of course! I’m just saying I’ll give them a quick call now and see if they’ve found your wallet. So ...
    Turn 22 (learner): “OK.”...


Repair 4:
  Turns: [26, 27, 28]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner misunderstanding of bot's stated actions/timeline
  Evidence: The learner asks 'Did you check?' despite the bot repeatedly stating it *will* make the call. The bot then responds as if it just completed the call, providing the outcome. The learner's 'Oh, really?' in turn 28 indicates surprise but acceptance of the new information, resolving the misunderstanding.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 26 (learner): “Did you check?”...
    Turn 27 (bot): I sure did. So I just got off the phone with them, and unfortunately, they didn't find any wallet ma...
    Turn 28 (learner): “Oh, really?”...


Repair 5:
  Turns: [34, 35, 36]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: pronunciation/ASR – misrecognition of learner's word ('7-1-1' instead of 'someone')
  Evidence: The learner asks 'What happens if a 7-1-1 finds it?'. The bot implicitly corrects '7-1-1' to 'someone' in its response. The learner accepts this by saying 'Okay, thank you so much' and continuing the conversation.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 34 (learner): “I have another question. What happens if a 7-1-1 finds it?”...
    Turn 35 (bot): Sure, that's a good question. If someone finds it and turns it in, we'll contact you right away so y...
    Turn 36 (learner): “Okay, thank you so much. I will check back tomorrow again.”...


Repair 6:
  Turns: [42, 43, 44]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: bot misunderstanding – bot assumes 'flooding'
  Evidence: After the learner mentions a 'big issue', the bot incorrectly assumes it's 'flooding'. The learner then clarifies that the air conditioner isn't working, and the bot acknowledges this clarification, resolving the misunderstanding.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 42 (bot): Absolutely, I can help with that. Let's start with what kind of issue you're having. Is it a leak, o...
    Turn 43 (learner): “My air conditioner isn't working and it's very hot. I'm almost boiling. I need help. Could you chec...
    Turn 44 (bot): Sure, I can definitely check that for you. Let me just see if we can get a maintenance person out th...


Repair 7:
  Turns: [55, 56, 57]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: language switch – learner uses a different language
  Evidence: The learner switches to Portuguese ('Está aí algo que eu deveria preparar antes de eles chegarem?'). The bot responds in English, implicitly signaling that the conversation should continue in English. The learner then reverts to English in the next turn, indicating the issue is resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 55 (learner): “Está aí algo que eu deveria preparar antes de eles chegarem?”...
    Turn 56 (bot): Not really, just make sure they can easily get to the air conditioner and that there's nothing block...
    Turn 57 (learner): “So, these problems will be fixed today.”...

FULL DIALOGUE:
================================================================================

Turn 1 (bot):
  Of course. [sound of papers shuffling] Good afternoon. I’m Officer Daniels — I’ll help you with your report today. Can you tell me when you first noticed your wallet was missing?

Turn 2 (learner):
  “Bye, Daniels.”

Turn 3 (bot):
  Hi there! All right, let’s get started. So just let me know roughly when you realized your wallet went missing, and we’ll take it from there.

Turn 4 (learner):
  “Last night, I have been in a pub. When I paid my account, I remember I put my wallet in my pocket. But after that, when I arrived in my house, my wallet didn't stay in my pocket.”

Turn 5 (bot):
  Got it. So it sounds like it might have gone missing sometime between the pub and getting home. Let me ask: do you remember which pub you were at, just so we have that on record?

Turn 6 (learner):
  “The name is IveClub.”

Turn 7 (bot):
  All right, thanks for

Turn 8 (learner):
  “I remember when I left the pub, I met some girls and I hugged the girls.”

Turn 9 (bot):
  All right, that’s

Turn 10 (learner):
  “beautiful girls, but I just talked together some time. I took it just some time. And after that, I leave it. And when I arrived in my house, didn't my wallet.”

Turn 11 (bot):
  Got it, that makes sense. So you chatted with them for a bit and then headed home. All right, we’ll note that down. Now, just to be thorough, do you remember if you noticed anyone acting suspicious or if you think the wallet might have fallen out somewhere along the way?

Turn 12 (learner):
  “I think no, but in my wallet, there's my driver's license and my MasterCard and $50 or $60.”

Turn 13 (bot):
  All right, thanks for letting me know what was inside. That's definitely helpful for the report. So we'll note down your driver’s license, your MasterCard, and about 50 to 60 dollars in cash. Now, we'll go ahead and file this and keep an eye out. Is there anything else you’d like to add before we wrap it up?

Turn 14 (learner):
  “Could you check in the pub if any wallet was found in the place?”

Turn 15 (bot):
  Absolutely, I can do that for you. I'll give the pub a quick call and see if anyone turned in a wallet matching your description. In the meantime, we'll have all your details on file here. Just hang tight and I’ll let you know what they say.

Turn 16 (learner):
  “Okay, I have more details. This wallet is black, it's the high-fired Heliosphere, the brain's Heliosphere, and there is a blue in the headline around this wallet.”

Turn 17 (bot):
  Perfect, that’s really helpful. So a black Tommy Hilfiger wallet with a blue outline detail—got it. I'll mention those specifics when I give them a call, and hopefully that helps track it down. Let me do that real quick and I’ll get back to you.

Turn 18 (learner):
  “OK. I will try.”

Turn 19 (bot):
  All right, thanks for waiting just a bit. I'll make that call and we’ll see what they say. Sit tight and I’ll be right back with an update.

Turn 20 (learner):
  “Could you repeat, please?”

Turn 21 (bot):
  Of course! I’m just saying I’ll give them a quick call now and see if they’ve found your wallet. So just hang on for a moment and I’ll let you know what I find out.

Turn 22 (learner):
  “OK.”

Turn 23 (bot):
  All right, thanks! I’ll handle that and get right back to you. Just a moment and we’ll see what they say.

Turn 24 (learner):
  “Okay, I'm waiting.”

Turn 25 (bot):
  Perfect, I appreciate your patience! I’ll go ahead and check in with them now. Just give me a second and I’ll let you know as soon as I hear back.

Turn 26 (learner):
  “Did you check?”

Turn 27 (bot):
  I sure did. So I just got off the phone with them, and unfortunately, they didn't find any wallet matching that description at the pub. But no worries, we've got all the details in the report here, and if anything turns up, we’ll let you know. Let me know if there's anything else you need!

Turn 28 (learner):
  “Oh, really?”

Turn 29 (bot):
  Yeah, unfortunately,

Turn 30 (learner):
  “Oh, it's so bad for me.”

Turn 31 (bot):
  I understand, it’s definitely frustrating to lose something like that. We’ll keep the report on file, and if anything comes up, we’ll let you know. In the meantime, if you need anything else, just let me know.

Turn 32 (learner):
  “What happens next if we finish it here?”

Turn 33 (bot):
  Absolutely. So from here, we’ve got everything noted down and we’ll keep an eye out. If anything turns up, we’ll contact you. Otherwise, you’re all set and we’re done here. Thanks for coming in, and take care!

Turn 34 (learner):
  “I have another question. What happens if a 7-1-1 finds it?”

Turn 35 (bot):
  Sure, that's a good question. If someone finds it and turns it in, we'll contact you right away so you can come pick it up. In the meantime, if you have any updates or if you find it yourself, just let us know.

Turn 36 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you so much. I will check back tomorrow again.”

Turn 37 (bot):
  You're very welcome! Feel free to check back anytime. We'll be here if you need anything else. Have a good day, and we’ll see you tomorrow if you need to follow up.

Turn 38 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you. I appreciate your attendance, and I hope you have a very good day.”

Turn 39 (bot):
  You're very welcome, and I really appreciate that. You have a great day as well! And of course, if you need anything else, just let us know. Take care! Task 3: Requesting Maintenance or Repairs in a Rental Property I will now call the real estate agency that manages the apartment I rent to report a problem that requires urgent maintenance. You will be the operator.

Turn 40 (bot):
  Sure! [phone ringing] Good afternoon, this is Emma from BrightHome Real Estate. How can I help you today? What seems to be the issue with your apartment?

Turn 41 (learner):
  “Hello, Emma. I have a big issue in my apartment. Could you help me?”

Turn 42 (bot):
  Absolutely, I can help with that. Let's start with what kind of issue you're having. Is it a leak, or is it something else that's causing the flooding?

Turn 43 (learner):
  “My air conditioner isn't working and it's very hot. I'm almost boiling. I need help. Could you check if someone can come here to fix it?”

Turn 44 (bot):
  Sure, I can definitely check that for you. Let me just see if we can get a maintenance person out there as soon as possible. Could you let me know your apartment number so I can look up the details and arrange that?

Turn 45 (learner):
  “It's number 100.”

Turn 46 (bot):
  Got it, apartment 100. Thanks for that. Let me just check our schedule really quickly. All right, it looks like we can have someone come out this afternoon to fix that AC for you. Does that timing work for you?

Turn 47 (learner):
  “Yes, of course, I have time here.”

Turn 48 (bot):
  All right, perfect! We’ll have someone out there this afternoon to take care of it for you. If you need anything else in the meantime, just let us know. Thanks for calling, and we’ll get that sorted out for you!

Turn 49 (learner):
  “Could they call or text me when they are on their way?”

Turn 50 (bot):
  Absolutely, we can do that. I’ll make sure they give you a quick call or text when they’re on their way over so you know when to expect them. Thanks for letting me know, and we’ll get that arranged.

Turn 51 (learner):
  “Do I need to stay home for repair?”

Turn 52 (bot):
  You’re welcome to if you prefer, but it’s not strictly necessary. If you’re comfortable with us having a key or access, we can handle it. Otherwise, you can just be home when they arrive. Whatever works best for you!

Turn 53 (learner):
  “I will leave the key at the reception if I am out, okay?”

Turn 54 (bot):
  Absolutely, that works perfectly. Just leave the key at the reception, and we'll let the maintenance team know to pick it up there. They’ll take care of everything and leave the key safely afterwards. So that’s all set!

Turn 55 (learner):
  “Está aí algo que eu deveria preparar antes de eles chegarem?”

Turn 56 (bot):
  Not really, just make sure they can easily get to the air conditioner and that there's nothing blocking the way. Other than that, you’re all set. We'll handle the rest!

Turn 57 (learner):
  “So, these problems will be fixed today.”

Turn 58 (bot):
  Yes, absolutely. We'll have someone there today to get it fixed for you. So by the end of the day, your AC should be back up and running. Let us know if you need anything else!

Turn 59 (learner):
  “Oh, thank you so much for organizing that so quickly.”

Turn 60 (bot):
  You’re very welcome! I’m glad we could get it sorted out fast for you. If you have any other issues, just let us know. Otherwise, have a great day!

Turn 61 (learner):
  “I hope you have a good day, too.”
