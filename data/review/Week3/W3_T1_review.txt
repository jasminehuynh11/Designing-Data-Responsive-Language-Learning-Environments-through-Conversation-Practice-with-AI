REPAIR DETAILS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repair 1:
  Turns: [7, 8, 9, 10]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: unintelligible speech / ASR error
  Evidence: The learner's speech in turn 7 was unintelligible, indicated by 'Transcrição indisponível'. The bot's response in turn 8 was incomplete, suggesting it did not fully process the learner's input. The learner initiated the repair by restarting with a clear greeting in turn 9, which the bot understood and responded to in turn 10, resolving the communication breakdown.

    Turn 10 (bot): Hi there! All right, let’s get started. Can you tell me a bit more about what exactly is going on wi...


Repair 2:
  Turns: [19, 20, 21]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: comprehension – learner did not understand bot's utterance
  Evidence: The learner explicitly signaled a lack of understanding of the bot's question in turn 18 by asking for a repeat in turn 19. The bot rephrased the question in turn 20, and the learner provided a coherent answer in turn 21, indicating the trouble was resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 19 (learner): “Could you repeat?”...
    Turn 20 (bot): Sure! So I was just asking if you could take a look at your router and see if any of the lights are ...
    Turn 21 (learner): “Hi, it's normal.”...


Repair 3:
  Turns: [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: comprehension – learner did not understand bot's utterance (repeatedly)
  Evidence: The learner repeatedly indicated a lack of understanding of the bot's question (turns 25, 27). The bot rephrased the question multiple times (turns 26, 28). Although the learner's final response in turn 29 was somewhat ambiguous, the bot successfully interpreted it in turn 30 ('it's just that one device acting up'), resolving the persistent misunderstanding and allowing the dialogue to continue.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 25 (learner): “Sorry, I can't understand. Could you repeat, please?”...
    Turn 26 (bot): Of course! So I was just asking if it's only one device having the problem or if all your devices ca...

Repair 4:
  Turns: [39, 40, 41]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: task misunderstanding – learner unsure of bot's current action/status
  Evidence: The learner asked the bot to check for an outage in turn 39, which the bot had already stated it was doing in previous turns (34, 36). This suggests the learner was unsure about the bot's current task status. The bot confirmed it was checking in turn 40, and the learner then moved on to a new question in turn 41, indicating the issue was resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 39 (learner): “Could you check if there is an outage in the area?”...
    Turn 40 (bot): Sure, I can definitely do that. Let me quickly check if there's an outage reported in your area. Jus...

Turn 1 (learner):
  Hi How are u?

Turn 2 (bot):
  Hey! I’m good, thanks for asking. How about you — how’s your day going so far?

Turn 3 (learner):
  I'm good. Thanks

Turn 4 (bot):
  Glad to hear that! What are you up to today?

Turn 5 (learner):
  Today you will be a call center operator for the internet company. I'm calling you because I'm having internet problems. So, you can start my call.

Turn 6 (bot):
  Sure! [phone line clicks] Hello, this is Alex from SkyNet Internet Support. Thanks for calling today. Can you please tell me what kind of problem you’re having with your internet?

Turn 7 (learner):
  Transcrição indisponível

Turn 8 (bot):
  Absolutely. So let

Turn 9 (learner):
  “Hi, Alex.”

Turn 10 (bot):
  Hi there! All right, let’s get started. Can you tell me a bit more about what exactly is going on with your connection right now?

Turn 11 (learner):
  “Oh, my internet doesn't work.”

Turn 12 (bot):
  Got it. So your internet’s not working at all. Let’s start with this: are you seeing any error messages on your devices or is it just not connecting?

Turn 13 (learner):
  “Not connecting, since 1 o'clock p.m., 1 p.m.”

Turn 14 (bot):
  All right, so it

Turn 15 (learner):
  “and in the morning it's okay, but now it doesn't work.”

Turn 16 (bot):
  I see. So it was working fine this morning, and now it’s just stopped. Let me ask: have you tried restarting your router since it went out?

Turn 17 (learner):
  “Yes, I tried.”

Turn 18 (bot):
  All right, good to know you’ve already tried that. In that case, let's check one more thing: do you have any lights on your router that are blinking or off that normally should be on?

Turn 19 (learner):
  “Could you repeat?”

Turn 20 (bot):
  Sure! So I was just asking if you could take a look at your router and see if any of the lights are blinking or off when they should normally be on. What do you see there?

Turn 21 (learner):
  “Hi, it's normal.”

Turn 22 (bot):
  All right, if the lights are normal, that’s helpful to know. Now, just to narrow it down a bit more, are you using Wi-Fi or a wired connection when you’re trying to get online?

Turn 23 (learner):
  “In the moment, I'm trying to use Wi-Fi, but our lights are not open.”

Turn 24 (bot):
  Gotcha. You're on Wi-Fi and not all the lights are on. That definitely gives us a clue. Now, have you noticed if any other devices in your home are having the same issue, or is it just this one device you're trying?

Turn 25 (learner):
  “Sorry, I can't understand. Could you repeat, please?”

Turn 26 (bot):
  Of course! So I was just asking if it's only one device having the problem or if all your devices can't connect. How is it for your other devices?

Turn 27 (learner):
  “Could you repeat, please?”

Turn 28 (bot):
  Sure thing! So basically, I'm just asking: are all of your devices having the same internet issue, or is it just this one you're using right now?

Turn 29 (learner):
  “I'll adjust it when I use it right now.”

Turn 30 (bot):
  All right, so it's just that one device acting up. That’s helpful to know. Let me ask you one more thing: have you tried forgetting the Wi-Fi network on that device and reconnecting it?

Turn 31 (learner):
  “Yes, I've tried but it doesn't work. I removed the socket on the wall and I put it again, but the wireless started, but it doesn't work. It doesn't have a signal, not for me and my other flatmates.”

Turn 32 (bot):
  All right, I get you. So you did try unplugging and plugging it back in, and it's still not giving a signal for you or your flatmates. Let me ask this next: have you contacted your internet service provider before about outages in your area, or is this the first time you're reaching out?

Turn 33 (learner):
  “It's my first time.”

Turn 34 (bot):
  All right, thanks for letting me know it's your first time reaching out. Let's do this: I'll go ahead and check if there's any known outage in your area on our end. Could you just tell me your address or the area you're located in?

Turn 35 (learner):
  “Of course, my address is Pitt Street.”

Turn 36 (bot):
  Perfect, thanks for that. Let me just take a quick look and see if there's any reported issue in that area. In the meantime, is there anything else about the situation you'd like me to know?

Turn 37 (learner):
  “Is there a technical available today?”

Turn 38 (bot):
  Absolutely, I can check that for you. Let me see if we have a technician available today who can come out and help. Meanwhile, is there a time today that would work best for you if we do need to send someone over?

Turn 39 (learner):
  “Could you check if there is an outage in the area?”

Turn 40 (bot):
  Sure, I can definitely do that. Let me quickly check if there's an outage reported in your area. Just give me a moment. In the meantime, if there's anything else that comes to mind about the problem, feel free to let me know.

Turn 41 (learner):
  “What should I try before you send someone?”

Turn 42 (bot):
  Yeah, of course! One last thing you might try is just restarting the device itself, like your computer or phone, and then reconnecting. But if that doesn't help, I'll definitely line up a technician for you. So let me know if that restart helps at all.

Turn 43 (learner):
  “Okay, but should I wait here, or will someone call me?”

Turn 44 (bot):
  Sure, you can just hang tight here for a moment, and I'll let you know what I find. So no worries, I'll give you the update right here. And if we do need to send someone, I'll let you know how that’ll work. Sound good?

Turn 45 (learner):
  “Good.”

Turn 46 (bot):
  Great! All right, I’ll just check that outage info and we’ll figure things out from there. So just sit tight, and I’ll let you know in a sec if we need to send someone or if there’s an update.

Turn 47 (learner):
  “Okay.”

Turn 48 (bot):
  All right, perfect! So I’m checking that for you now. Just give me a moment and I’ll let you know what I find. In the meantime, just relax and I’ll keep you posted in just a sec.

Turn 49 (learner):
  “Yes, okay, I will to wait you.”

Turn 50 (bot):
  All right, thanks for your patience! I’ll let you know as soon as I’ve got that info. So just hang tight for a moment and I’ll get right back to you.

Turn 51 (learner):
  “OK.”

Turn 52 (bot):
  Great! So I’ve checked and it looks like there actually is a small outage in your area, which might explain the problem. We’re already working on it, and it should be fixed in a few hours. If you still have issues after that, just let us know and we can send someone out. Anything else I can help with?

Turn 53 (learner):
  “Who can I contact if this isn't resolved today?”

Turn 54 (bot):
  Sure! If it’s not resolved today, you can just contact us again at this same support line and we’ll be happy to help. We’re here 24/7, so just reach out if you need anything else.

Turn 55 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you.”

Turn 56 (bot):
  You're very welcome! If you need anything else, just let me know. Otherwise, I hope your internet is back up and running soon. Thanks for calling and have a great day!

Turn 57 (learner):
  “I hope you have a great day, too.”

Turn 58 (bot):
  Thank you so much! I appreciate that. All right, well, if there's nothing else, feel free to reach out anytime. Have a lovely day!

Turn 59 (learner):
  “You, too.”
