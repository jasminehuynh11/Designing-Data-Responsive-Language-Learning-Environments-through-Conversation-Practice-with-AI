REPAIR DETAILS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repair 1:
  Turns: [7, 8, 9, 10]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: unintelligible speech / ASR error
  Evidence: The learner's speech in turn 7 was unintelligible, indicated by 'Transcrição indisponível'. The bot's response in turn 8 was incomplete, suggesting it did not fully process the learner's input. The learner initiated the repair by restarting with a clear greeting in turn 9, which the bot understood and responded to in turn 10, resolving the communication breakdown.

    Turn 8 [BOT]: Absolutely. So let...
    Turn 9 [LEARNER]: “Hi, Alex.”...
    Turn 10 [BOT]: Hi there! All right, let’s get started. Can you tell me a bit more about what exactly is going on wi...


Repair 2:
  Turns: [19, 20, 21]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: comprehension – learner did not understand bot's utterance
  Evidence: The learner explicitly signaled a lack of understanding of the bot's question in turn 18 by asking for a repeat in turn 19. The bot rephrased the question in turn 20, and the learner provided a coherent answer in turn 21, indicating the trouble was resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 19 [LEARNER]: “Could you repeat?”...
    Turn 20 [BOT]: Sure! So I was just asking if you could take a look at your router and see if any of the lights are ...
    Turn 21 [LEARNER]: “Hi, it's normal.”...


Repair 3:
  Turns: [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: comprehension – learner did not understand bot's utterance (repeatedly)
  Evidence: The learner repeatedly indicated a lack of understanding of the bot's question (turns 25, 27). The bot rephrased the question multiple times (turns 26, 28). Although the learner's final response in turn 29 was somewhat ambiguous, the bot successfully interpreted it in turn 30 ('it's just that one device acting up'), resolving the persistent misunderstanding and allowing the dialogue to continue.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 25 [LEARNER]: “Sorry, I can't understand. Could you repeat, please?”...
    Turn 26 [BOT]: Of course! So I was just asking if it's only one device having the problem or if all your devices ca...

Repair 4:
  Turns: [39, 40, 41]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: task misunderstanding – learner unsure of bot's current action/status
  Evidence: The learner asked the bot to check for an outage in turn 39, which the bot had already stated it was doing in previous turns (34, 36). This suggests the learner was unsure about the bot's current task status. The bot confirmed it was checking in turn 40, and the learner then moved on to a new question in turn 41, indicating the issue was resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 39 [LEARNER]: “Could you check if there is an outage in the area?”...
    Turn 40 [BOT]: Sure, I can definitely do that. Let me quickly check if there's an outage reported in your area. Jus...
    Turn 41 [LEARNER]: “What should I try before you send someone?”...

Turn   1 [LEARNER ]: Hi How are u?
Turn   2 [BOT     ]: Hey! I’m good, thanks for asking. How about you — how’s your day going so far?
Turn   3 [LEARNER ]: I'm good. Thanks
Turn   4 [BOT     ]: Glad to hear that! What are you up to today?
Turn   5 [LEARNER ]: Today you will be a call center operator for the internet company. I'm calling you because I'm having internet problems. So, you can start my call.
Turn   6 [BOT     ]: Sure! [phone line clicks] Hello, this is Alex from SkyNet Internet Support. Thanks for calling today. Can you please tell me what kind of problem you’re having with your internet?
Turn   7 [LEARNER ]: Transcrição indisponível
Turn   8 [BOT     ]: Absolutely. So let
Turn   9 [LEARNER ]: “Hi, Alex.”
Turn  10 [BOT     ]: Hi there! All right, let’s get started. Can you tell me a bit more about what exactly is going on with your connection right now?
Turn  11 [LEARNER ]: “Oh, my internet doesn't work.”
Turn  12 [BOT     ]: Got it. So your internet’s not working at all. Let’s start with this: are you seeing any error messages on your devices or is it just not connecting?
Turn  13 [LEARNER ]: “Not connecting, since 1 o'clock p.m., 1 p.m.”
Turn  14 [BOT     ]: All right, so it
Turn  15 [LEARNER ]: “and in the morning it's okay, but now it doesn't work.”
Turn  16 [BOT     ]: I see. So it was working fine this morning, and now it’s just stopped. Let me ask: have you tried restarting your router since it went out?
Turn  17 [LEARNER ]: “Yes, I tried.”
Turn  18 [BOT     ]: All right, good to know you’ve already tried that. In that case, let's check one more thing: do you have any lights on your router that are blinking or off that normally should be on?
Turn  19 [LEARNER ]: “Could you repeat?”
Turn  20 [BOT     ]: Sure! So I was just asking if you could take a look at your router and see if any of the lights are blinking or off when they should normally be on. What do you see there?
Turn  21 [LEARNER ]: “Hi, it's normal.”
Turn  22 [BOT     ]: All right, if the lights are normal, that’s helpful to know. Now, just to narrow it down a bit more, are you using Wi-Fi or a wired connection when you’re trying to get online?
Turn  23 [LEARNER ]: “In the moment, I'm trying to use Wi-Fi, but our lights are not open.”
Turn  24 [BOT     ]: Gotcha. You're on Wi-Fi and not all the lights are on. That definitely gives us a clue. Now, have you noticed if any other devices in your home are having the same issue, or is it just this one device you're trying?
Turn  25 [LEARNER ]: “Sorry, I can't understand. Could you repeat, please?”
Turn  26 [BOT     ]: Of course! So I was just asking if it's only one device having the problem or if all your devices can't connect. How is it for your other devices?
Turn  27 [LEARNER ]: “Could you repeat, please?”
Turn  28 [BOT     ]: Sure thing! So basically, I'm just asking: are all of your devices having the same internet issue, or is it just this one you're using right now?
Turn  29 [LEARNER ]: “I'll adjust it when I use it right now.”
Turn  30 [BOT     ]: All right, so it's just that one device acting up. That’s helpful to know. Let me ask you one more thing: have you tried forgetting the Wi-Fi network on that device and reconnecting it?
Turn  31 [LEARNER ]: “Yes, I've tried but it doesn't work. I removed the socket on the wall and I put it again, but the wireless started, but it doesn't work. It doesn't have a signal, not for me and my other flatmates.”
Turn  32 [BOT     ]: All right, I get you. So you did try unplugging and plugging it back in, and it's still not giving a signal for you or your flatmates. Let me ask this next: have you contacted your internet service provider before about outages in your area, or is this the first time you're reaching out?
Turn  33 [LEARNER ]: “It's my first time.”
Turn  34 [BOT     ]: All right, thanks for letting me know it's your first time reaching out. Let's do this: I'll go ahead and check if there's any known outage in your area on our end. Could you just tell me your address or the area you're located in?
Turn  35 [LEARNER ]: “Of course, my address is Pitt Street.”
Turn  36 [BOT     ]: Perfect, thanks for that. Let me just take a quick look and see if there's any reported issue in that area. In the meantime, is there anything else about the situation you'd like me to know?
Turn  37 [LEARNER ]: “Is there a technical available today?”
Turn  38 [BOT     ]: Absolutely, I can check that for you. Let me see if we have a technician available today who can come out and help. Meanwhile, is there a time today that would work best for you if we do need to send someone over?
Turn  39 [LEARNER ]: “Could you check if there is an outage in the area?”
Turn  40 [BOT     ]: Sure, I can definitely do that. Let me quickly check if there's an outage reported in your area. Just give me a moment. In the meantime, if there's anything else that comes to mind about the problem, feel free to let me know.
Turn  41 [LEARNER ]: “What should I try before you send someone?”
Turn  42 [BOT     ]: Yeah, of course! One last thing you might try is just restarting the device itself, like your computer or phone, and then reconnecting. But if that doesn't help, I'll definitely line up a technician for you. So let me know if that restart helps at all.
Turn  43 [LEARNER ]: “Okay, but should I wait here, or will someone call me?”
Turn  44 [BOT     ]: Sure, you can just hang tight here for a moment, and I'll let you know what I find. So no worries, I'll give you the update right here. And if we do need to send someone, I'll let you know how that’ll work. Sound good?
Turn  45 [LEARNER ]: “Good.”
Turn  46 [BOT     ]: Great! All right, I’ll just check that outage info and we’ll figure things out from there. So just sit tight, and I’ll let you know in a sec if we need to send someone or if there’s an update.
Turn  47 [LEARNER ]: “Okay.”
Turn  48 [BOT     ]: All right, perfect! So I’m checking that for you now. Just give me a moment and I’ll let you know what I find. In the meantime, just relax and I’ll keep you posted in just a sec.
Turn  49 [LEARNER ]: “Yes, okay, I will to wait you.”
Turn  50 [BOT     ]: All right, thanks for your patience! I’ll let you know as soon as I’ve got that info. So just hang tight for a moment and I’ll get right back to you.
Turn  51 [LEARNER ]: “OK.”
Turn  52 [BOT     ]: Great! So I’ve checked and it looks like there actually is a small outage in your area, which might explain the problem. We’re already working on it, and it should be fixed in a few hours. If you still have issues after that, just let us know and we can send someone out. Anything else I can help with?
Turn  53 [LEARNER ]: “Who can I contact if this isn't resolved today?”
Turn  54 [BOT     ]: Sure! If it’s not resolved today, you can just contact us again at this same support line and we’ll be happy to help. We’re here 24/7, so just reach out if you need anything else.
Turn  55 [LEARNER ]: “Okay, thank you.”
Turn  56 [BOT     ]: You're very welcome! If you need anything else, just let me know. Otherwise, I hope your internet is back up and running soon. Thanks for calling and have a great day!
Turn  57 [LEARNER ]: “I hope you have a great day, too.”
Turn  58 [BOT     ]: Thank you so much! I appreciate that. All right, well, if there's nothing else, feel free to reach out anytime. Have a lovely day!
Turn  59 [LEARNER ]: “You, too.”

  Turns: [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner did not understand bot's question (multiple attempts)
  Evidence: The learner repeatedly indicated a lack of understanding of the bot's question in Turns 25 and 27. The bot made multiple attempts to rephrase the question (Turns 26, 28). Although the learner's final response in Turn 29 was somewhat unclear, the bot successfully interpreted it in Turn 30, allowing the dialogue to move forward, indicating resolution.

  Turns: [39, 40]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner uncertainty about task status
  Evidence: The learner asked the bot to check for an outage again in Turn 39, suggesting uncertainty about whether the bot had understood or was acting on the previous request. The bot confirmed it would check in Turn 40, and the learner then moved to a new topic in Turn 41, indicating the uncertainty was resolved.

  Turn Content:

    Turn 40 [BOT]: Sure, I can definitely do that. Let me quickly check if there's an outage reported in your area. Jus...


Repair 5:
  Turns: [62, 63, 64]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner misunderstanding of bot's name/greeting
  Evidence: The learner misinterpreted the bot's introduction ("Officer Daniels") as a farewell in Turn 62, responding with "Bye, Daniels." The bot implicitly initiated a repair in Turn 63 by re-greeting and re-prompting the task question, signaling that the conversation was continuing. The learner then correctly engaged with the task in Turn 64, indicating the misunderstanding was resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 62 [LEARNER]: “Bye, Daniels.”...

Turn  59 [LEARNER ]: “You, too.”
Turn  60 [BOT     ]: Thanks a lot! Take care and I’ll be here if you need anything else. Have a good one! Task 2: Reporting a Lost Item or Filing a Minor Police Report Now you will be working as an officer at a police station. I need to report the loss of my wallet. tham, I have just arrived at the police station and you will be assisting me.
Turn  61 [BOT     ]: Of course. [sound of papers shuffling] Good afternoon. I’m Officer Daniels — I’ll help you with your report today. Can you tell me when you first noticed your wallet was missing?
Turn  62 [LEARNER ]: “Bye, Daniels.”
Turn  63 [BOT     ]: Hi there! All right, let’s get started. So just let me know roughly when you realized your wallet went missing, and we’ll take it from there.
Turn  64 [LEARNER ]: “Last night, I have been in a pub. When I paid my account, I remember I put my wallet in my pocket. But after that, when I arrived in my house, my wallet didn't stay in my pocket.”
Turn  65 [BOT     ]: Got it. So it sounds like it might have gone missing sometime between the pub and getting home. Let me ask: do you remember which pub you were at, just so we have that on record?
Turn  66 [LEARNER ]: “The name is IveClub.”
Turn  67 [BOT     ]: All right, thanks for
Turn  68 [LEARNER ]: “I remember when I left the pub, I met some girls and I hugged the girls.”
Turn  69 [BOT     ]: All right, that’s
Turn  70 [LEARNER ]: “beautiful girls, but I just talked together some time. I took it just some time. And after that, I leave it. And when I arrived in my house, didn't my wallet.”
Turn  71 [BOT     ]: Got it, that makes sense. So you chatted with them for a bit and then headed home. All right, we’ll note that down. Now, just to be thorough, do you remember if you noticed anyone acting suspicious or if you think the wallet might have fallen out somewhere along the way?
Turn  72 [LEARNER ]: “I think no, but in my wallet, there's my driver's license and my MasterCard and $50 or $60.”
Turn  73 [BOT     ]: All right, thanks for letting me know what was inside. That's definitely helpful for the report. So we'll note down your driver’s license, your MasterCard, and about 50 to 60 dollars in cash. Now, we'll go ahead and file this and keep an eye out. Is there anything else you’d like to add before we wrap it up?
Turn  74 [LEARNER ]: “Could you check in the pub if any wallet was found in the place?”
Turn  75 [BOT     ]: Absolutely, I can do that for you. I'll give the pub a quick call and see if anyone turned in a wallet matching your description. In the meantime, we'll have all your details on file here. Just hang tight and I’ll let you know what they say.
Turn  76 [LEARNER ]: “Okay, I have more details. This wallet is black, it's the high-fired Heliosphere, the brain's Heliosphere, and there is a blue in the headline around this wallet.”
Turn  77 [BOT     ]: Perfect, that’s really helpful. So a black Tommy Hilfiger wallet with a blue outline detail—got it. I'll mention those specifics when I give them a call, and hopefully that helps track it down. Let me do that real quick and I’ll get back to you.
Turn  78 [LEARNER ]: “OK. I will try.”
Turn  79 [BOT     ]: All right, thanks for waiting just a bit. I'll make that call and we’ll see what they say. Sit tight and I’ll be right back with an update.
Turn  80 [LEARNER ]: “Could you repeat, please?”
Turn  81 [BOT     ]: Of course! I’m just saying I’ll give them a quick call now and see if they’ve found your wallet. So just hang on for a moment and I’ll let you know what I find out.
Turn  82 [LEARNER ]: “OK.”
Turn  83 [BOT     ]: All right, thanks! I’ll handle that and get right back to you. Just a moment and we’ll see what they say.
Turn  84 [LEARNER ]: “Okay, I'm waiting.”
Turn  85 [BOT     ]: Perfect, I appreciate your patience! I’ll go ahead and check in with them now. Just give me a second and I’ll let you know as soon as I hear back.
Turn  86 [LEARNER ]: “Did you check?”
Turn  87 [BOT     ]: I sure did. So I just got off the phone with them, and unfortunately, they didn't find any wallet matching that description at the pub. But no worries, we've got all the details in the report here, and if anything turns up, we’ll let you know. Let me know if there's anything else you need!
Turn  88 [LEARNER ]: “Oh, really?”
Turn  89 [BOT     ]: Yeah, unfortunately,
Turn  90 [LEARNER ]: “Oh, it's so bad for me.”
Turn  91 [BOT     ]: I understand, it’s definitely frustrating to lose something like that. We’ll keep the report on file, and if anything comes up, we’ll let you know. In the meantime, if you need anything else, just let me know.
Turn  92 [LEARNER ]: “What happens next if we finish it here?”
Turn  93 [BOT     ]: Absolutely. So from here, we’ve got everything noted down and we’ll keep an eye out. If anything turns up, we’ll contact you. Otherwise, you’re all set and we’re done here. Thanks for coming in, and take care!
Turn  94 [LEARNER ]: “I have another question. What happens if a 7-1-1 finds it?”
Turn  95 [BOT     ]: Sure, that's a good question. If someone finds it and turns it in, we'll contact you right away so you can come pick it up. In the meantime, if you have any updates or if you find it yourself, just let us know.
Turn  96 [LEARNER ]: “Okay, thank you so much. I will check back tomorrow again.”
Turn  97 [BOT     ]: You're very welcome! Feel free to check back anytime. We'll be here if you need anything else. Have a good day, and we’ll see you tomorrow if you need to follow up.
Turn  98 [LEARNER ]: “Okay, thank you. I appreciate your attendance, and I hope you have a very good day.”

REPAIR DETAILS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repair 1:
  Turns: [2, 3]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner's inappropriate greeting
  Evidence: The learner responds with an inappropriate 'Bye, Daniels' to the bot's introduction and question. The bot implicitly corrects this by starting its next turn with 'Hi there!' and re-prompting the original question, which the learner accepts by continuing the task.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 2 [LEARNER]: “Bye, Daniels.”...
    Turn 3 [BOT]: Hi there! All right, let’s get started. So just let me know roughly when you realized your wallet we...


Repair 2:
  Turns: [16, 17, 18]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: pronunciation/ASR – misrecognition of learner's description
  Evidence: The learner attempts to describe the wallet using unclear phrases like 'high-fired Heliosphere, the brain's Heliosphere'. The bot interprets this as 'Tommy Hilfiger wallet' and the learner accepts this interpretation by saying 'OK' and moving on.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 16 [LEARNER]: “Okay, I have more details. This wallet is black, it's the high-fired Heliosphere, the brain's Helio...

    Turn 18 [LEARNER]: “OK. I will try.”...


Repair 3:
  Turns: [20, 21, 22]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: lack of understanding – learner didn't catch bot's previous utterance
  Evidence: The learner explicitly asks 'Could you repeat, please?', indicating they did not understand the bot's previous turn. The bot repeats its message, and the learner confirms understanding with 'OK'.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 20 [LEARNER]: “Could you repeat, please?”...
    Turn 21 [BOT]: Of course! I’m just saying I’ll give them a quick call now and see if they’ve found your wallet. So ...
    Turn 22 [LEARNER]: “OK.”...


Repair 4:
  Turns: [26, 27, 28]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner misunderstanding of bot's stated actions/timeline
  Evidence: The learner asks 'Did you check?' despite the bot repeatedly stating it *will* make the call. The bot then responds as if it just completed the call, providing the outcome. The learner's 'Oh, really?' in turn 28 indicates surprise but acceptance of the new information, resolving the misunderstanding.

    Turn 26 [LEARNER]: “Did you check?”...
    Turn 27 [BOT]: I sure did. So I just got off the phone with them, and unfortunately, they didn't find any wallet ma...

Repair 5:
  Turns: [34, 35, 36]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: pronunciation/ASR – misrecognition of learner's word ('7-1-1' instead of 'someone')
  Evidence: The learner asks 'What happens if a 7-1-1 finds it?'. The bot implicitly corrects '7-1-1' to 'someone' in its response. The learner accepts this by saying 'Okay, thank you so much' and continuing the conversation.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 34 [LEARNER]: “I have another question. What happens if a 7-1-1 finds it?”...
    Turn 35 [BOT]: Sure, that's a good question. If someone finds it and turns it in, we'll contact you right away so y...
    Turn 36 [LEARNER]: “Okay, thank you so much. I will check back tomorrow again.”...


Repair 6:
  Turns: [42, 43, 44]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: bot misunderstanding – bot assumes 'flooding'
  Evidence: After the learner mentions a 'big issue', the bot incorrectly assumes it's 'flooding'. The learner then clarifies that the air conditioner isn't working, and the bot acknowledges this clarification, resolving the misunderstanding.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 42 [BOT]: Absolutely, I can help with that. Let's start with what kind of issue you're having. Is it a leak, o...

Repair 7:
  Turns: [55, 56, 57]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: language switch – learner uses a different language
  Evidence: The learner switches to Portuguese ('Está aí algo que eu deveria preparar antes de eles chegarem?'). The bot responds in English, implicitly signaling that the conversation should continue in English. The learner then reverts to English in the next turn, indicating the issue is resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 55 [LEARNER]: “Está aí algo que eu deveria preparar antes de eles chegarem?”...
    Turn 56 [BOT]: Not really, just make sure they can easily get to the air conditioner and that there's nothing block...
    Turn 57 [LEARNER]: “So, these problems will be fixed today.”...

FULL DIALOGUE
================================================================================

Turn   1 [BOT     ]: Of course. [sound of papers shuffling] Good afternoon. I’m Officer Daniels — I’ll help you with your report today. Can you tell me when you first noticed your wallet was missing?
Turn   2 [LEARNER ]: “Bye, Daniels.”
Turn   3 [BOT     ]: Hi there! All right, let’s get started. So just let me know roughly when you realized your wallet went missing, and we’ll take it from there.
Turn   4 [LEARNER ]: “Last night, I have been in a pub. When I paid my account, I remember I put my wallet in my pocket. But after that, when I arrived in my house, my wallet didn't stay in my pocket.”
Turn   5 [BOT     ]: Got it. So it sounds like it might have gone missing sometime between the pub and getting home. Let me ask: do you remember which pub you were at, just so we have that on record?
Turn   6 [LEARNER ]: “The name is IveClub.”
Turn   7 [BOT     ]: All right, thanks for
Turn   8 [LEARNER ]: “I remember when I left the pub, I met some girls and I hugged the girls.”
Turn   9 [BOT     ]: All right, that’s
Turn  10 [LEARNER ]: “beautiful girls, but I just talked together some time. I took it just some time. And after that, I leave it. And when I arrived in my house, didn't my wallet.”
Turn  11 [BOT     ]: Got it, that makes sense. So you chatted with them for a bit and then headed home. All right, we’ll note that down. Now, just to be thorough, do you remember if you noticed anyone acting suspicious or if you think the wallet might have fallen out somewhere along the way?
Turn  12 [LEARNER ]: “I think no, but in my wallet, there's my driver's license and my MasterCard and $50 or $60.”
Turn  13 [BOT     ]: All right, thanks for letting me know what was inside. That's definitely helpful for the report. So we'll note down your driver’s license, your MasterCard, and about 50 to 60 dollars in cash. Now, we'll go ahead and file this and keep an eye out. Is there anything else you’d like to add before we wrap it up?
Turn  14 [LEARNER ]: “Could you check in the pub if any wallet was found in the place?”
Turn  15 [BOT     ]: Absolutely, I can do that for you. I'll give the pub a quick call and see if anyone turned in a wallet matching your description. In the meantime, we'll have all your details on file here. Just hang tight and I’ll let you know what they say.

Turn  38 [LEARNER ]: “Okay, thank you. I appreciate your attendance, and I hope you have a very good day.”
Turn  39 [BOT     ]: You're very welcome, and I really appreciate that. You have a great day as well! And of course, if you need anything else, just let us know. Take care! Task 3: Requesting Maintenance or Repairs in a Rental Property I will now call the real estate agency that manages the apartment I rent to report a problem that requires urgent maintenance. You will be the operator.
Turn  40 [BOT     ]: Sure! [phone ringing] Good afternoon, this is Emma from BrightHome Real Estate. How can I help you today? What seems to be the issue with your apartment?
Turn  41 [LEARNER ]: “Hello, Emma. I have a big issue in my apartment. Could you help me?”
Turn  42 [BOT     ]: Absolutely, I can help with that. Let's start with what kind of issue you're having. Is it a leak, or is it something else that's causing the flooding?
Turn  43 [LEARNER ]: “My air conditioner isn't working and it's very hot. I'm almost boiling. I need help. Could you check if someone can come here to fix it?”
Turn  44 [BOT     ]: Sure, I can definitely check that for you. Let me just see if we can get a maintenance person out there as soon as possible. Could you let me know your apartment number so I can look up the details and arrange that?
Turn  45 [LEARNER ]: “It's number 100.”
Turn  46 [BOT     ]: Got it, apartment 100. Thanks for that. Let me just check our schedule really quickly. All right, it looks like we can have someone come out this afternoon to fix that AC for you. Does that timing work for you?
Turn  47 [LEARNER ]: “Yes, of course, I have time here.”
Turn  48 [BOT     ]: All right, perfect! We’ll have someone out there this afternoon to take care of it for you. If you need anything else in the meantime, just let us know. Thanks for calling, and we’ll get that sorted out for you!
Turn  49 [LEARNER ]: “Could they call or text me when they are on their way?”
Turn  50 [BOT     ]: Absolutely, we can do that. I’ll make sure they give you a quick call or text when they’re on their way over so you know when to expect them. Thanks for letting me know, and we’ll get that arranged.
Turn  51 [LEARNER ]: “Do I need to stay home for repair?”
Turn  52 [BOT     ]: You’re welcome to if you prefer, but it’s not strictly necessary. If you’re comfortable with us having a key or access, we can handle it. Otherwise, you can just be home when they arrive. Whatever works best for you!
Turn  53 [LEARNER ]: “I will leave the key at the reception if I am out, okay?”
Turn  54 [BOT     ]: Absolutely, that works perfectly. Just leave the key at the reception, and we'll let the maintenance team know to pick it up there. They’ll take care of everything and leave the key safely afterwards. So that’s all set!
Turn  55 [LEARNER ]: “Está aí algo que eu deveria preparar antes de eles chegarem?”
Turn  56 [BOT     ]: Not really, just make sure they can easily get to the air conditioner and that there's nothing blocking the way. Other than that, you’re all set. We'll handle the rest!
Turn  57 [LEARNER ]: “So, these problems will be fixed today.”
Turn  58 [BOT     ]: Yes, absolutely. We'll have someone there today to get it fixed for you. So by the end of the day, your AC should be back up and running. Let us know if you need anything else!
Turn  59 [LEARNER ]: “Oh, thank you so much for organizing that so quickly.”
Turn  60 [BOT     ]: You’re very welcome! I’m glad we could get it sorted out fast for you. If you have any other issues, just let us know. Otherwise, have a great day!
Turn  61 [LEARNER ]: “I hope you have a good day, too.”
