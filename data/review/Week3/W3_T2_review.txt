REPAIR DETAILS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repair 1:
  Turns: [7, 8, 9, 10]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: pronunciation/ASR – misrecognition of learner speech
  Evidence: The learner's utterance in Turn 7 was unintelligible ("Transcrição indisponível"). After an incomplete bot response in Turn 8, the learner re-initiated the conversation in Turn 9 ("Hi, Alex."), implicitly signaling trouble and attempting to fix it. The bot then re-prompts in Turn 10, and the dialogue continues, indicating resolution.

    Turn 8 (bot): Absolutely. So let...
    Turn 9 (learner): “Hi, Alex.”...
    Turn 10 (bot): Hi there! All right, let’s get started. Can you tell me a bit more about what exactly is going on wi...


Repair 2:
  Turns: [19, 20, 21]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner did not understand bot's question
  Evidence: The learner explicitly asked for a repetition in Turn 19, indicating they did not understand the bot's previous question. The bot rephrased the question in Turn 20, and the learner provided a relevant answer in Turn 21, resolving the misunderstanding.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 19 (learner): “Could you repeat?”...
    Turn 20 (bot): Sure! So I was just asking if you could take a look at your router and see if any of the lights are ...
    Turn 21 (learner): “Hi, it's normal.”...


Repair 3:
  Turns: [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner did not understand bot's question (multiple attempts)
  Evidence: The learner repeatedly indicated a lack of understanding of the bot's question in Turns 25 and 27. The bot made multiple attempts to rephrase the question (Turns 26, 28). Although the learner's final response in Turn 29 was somewhat unclear, the bot successfully interpreted it in Turn 30, allowing the dialogue to move forward, indicating resolution.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 25 (learner): “Sorry, I can't understand. Could you repeat, please?”...
    Turn 26 (bot): Of course! So I was just asking if it's only one device having the problem or if all your devices ca...
    Turn 27 (learner): “Could you repeat, please?”...
    Turn 28 (bot): Sure thing! So basically, I'm just asking: are all of your devices having the same internet issue, o...
    Turn 29 (learner): “I'll adjust it when I use it right now.”...
    Turn 30 (bot): All right, so it's just that one device acting up. That’s helpful to know. Let me ask you one more t...


Repair 4:
  Turns: [39, 40]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner uncertainty about task status
  Evidence: The learner asked the bot to check for an outage again in Turn 39, suggesting uncertainty about whether the bot had understood or was acting on the previous request. The bot confirmed it would check in Turn 40, and the learner then moved to a new topic in Turn 41, indicating the uncertainty was resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 39 (learner): “Could you check if there is an outage in the area?”...
    Turn 40 (bot): Sure, I can definitely do that. Let me quickly check if there's an outage reported in your area. Jus...


Repair 5:
  Turns: [62, 63, 64]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner misunderstanding of bot's name/greeting
  Evidence: The learner misinterpreted the bot's introduction ("Officer Daniels") as a farewell in Turn 62, responding with "Bye, Daniels." The bot implicitly initiated a repair in Turn 63 by re-greeting and re-prompting the task question, signaling that the conversation was continuing. The learner then correctly engaged with the task in Turn 64, indicating the misunderstanding was resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 62 (learner): “Bye, Daniels.”...
    Turn 63 (bot): Hi there! All right, let’s get started. So just let me know roughly when you realized your wallet we...
    Turn 64 (learner): “Last night, I have been in a pub. When I paid my account, I remember I put my wallet in my pocket. ...


Repair 6:
  Turns: [80, 81, 82]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner did not understand bot's statement
  Evidence: The learner explicitly requested a repetition in Turn 80, indicating a lack of understanding of the bot's previous statement. The bot rephrased its statement in Turn 81, and the learner confirmed understanding with "OK" in Turn 82, resolving the issue.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 80 (learner): “Could you repeat, please?”...
    Turn 81 (bot): Of course! I’m just saying I’ll give them a quick call now and see if they’ve found your wallet. So ...
    Turn 82 (learner): “OK.”...

Turn 1 (learner):
  Hi How are u?

Turn 2 (bot):
  Hey! I’m good, thanks for asking. How about you — how’s your day going so far?

Turn 3 (learner):
  I'm good. Thanks

Turn 4 (bot):
  Glad to hear that! What are you up to today?

Turn 5 (learner):
  Today you will be a call center operator for the internet company. I'm calling you because I'm having internet problems. So, you can start my call.

Turn 6 (bot):
  Sure! [phone line clicks] Hello, this is Alex from SkyNet Internet Support. Thanks for calling today. Can you please tell me what kind of problem you’re having with your internet?

Turn 7 (learner):
  Transcrição indisponível

Turn 8 (bot):
  Absolutely. So let

Turn 9 (learner):
  “Hi, Alex.”

Turn 10 (bot):
  Hi there! All right, let’s get started. Can you tell me a bit more about what exactly is going on with your connection right now?

Turn 11 (learner):
  “Oh, my internet doesn't work.”

Turn 12 (bot):
  Got it. So your internet’s not working at all. Let’s start with this: are you seeing any error messages on your devices or is it just not connecting?

Turn 13 (learner):
  “Not connecting, since 1 o'clock p.m., 1 p.m.”

Turn 14 (bot):
  All right, so it

Turn 15 (learner):
  “and in the morning it's okay, but now it doesn't work.”

Turn 16 (bot):
  I see. So it was working fine this morning, and now it’s just stopped. Let me ask: have you tried restarting your router since it went out?

Turn 17 (learner):
  “Yes, I tried.”

Turn 18 (bot):
  All right, good to know you’ve already tried that. In that case, let's check one more thing: do you have any lights on your router that are blinking or off that normally should be on?

Turn 19 (learner):
  “Could you repeat?”

Turn 20 (bot):
  Sure! So I was just asking if you could take a look at your router and see if any of the lights are blinking or off when they should normally be on. What do you see there?

Turn 21 (learner):
  “Hi, it's normal.”

Turn 22 (bot):
  All right, if the lights are normal, that’s helpful to know. Now, just to narrow it down a bit more, are you using Wi-Fi or a wired connection when you’re trying to get online?

Turn 23 (learner):
  “In the moment, I'm trying to use Wi-Fi, but our lights are not open.”

Turn 24 (bot):
  Gotcha. You're on Wi-Fi and not all the lights are on. That definitely gives us a clue. Now, have you noticed if any other devices in your home are having the same issue, or is it just this one device you're trying?

Turn 25 (learner):
  “Sorry, I can't understand. Could you repeat, please?”

Turn 26 (bot):
  Of course! So I was just asking if it's only one device having the problem or if all your devices can't connect. How is it for your other devices?

Turn 27 (learner):
  “Could you repeat, please?”

Turn 28 (bot):
  Sure thing! So basically, I'm just asking: are all of your devices having the same internet issue, or is it just this one you're using right now?

Turn 29 (learner):
  “I'll adjust it when I use it right now.”

Turn 30 (bot):
  All right, so it's just that one device acting up. That’s helpful to know. Let me ask you one more thing: have you tried forgetting the Wi-Fi network on that device and reconnecting it?

Turn 31 (learner):
  “Yes, I've tried but it doesn't work. I removed the socket on the wall and I put it again, but the wireless started, but it doesn't work. It doesn't have a signal, not for me and my other flatmates.”

Turn 32 (bot):
  All right, I get you. So you did try unplugging and plugging it back in, and it's still not giving a signal for you or your flatmates. Let me ask this next: have you contacted your internet service provider before about outages in your area, or is this the first time you're reaching out?

Turn 33 (learner):
  “It's my first time.”

Turn 34 (bot):
  All right, thanks for letting me know it's your first time reaching out. Let's do this: I'll go ahead and check if there's any known outage in your area on our end. Could you just tell me your address or the area you're located in?

Turn 35 (learner):
  “Of course, my address is Pitt Street.”

Turn 36 (bot):
  Perfect, thanks for that. Let me just take a quick look and see if there's any reported issue in that area. In the meantime, is there anything else about the situation you'd like me to know?

Turn 37 (learner):
  “Is there a technical available today?”

Turn 38 (bot):
  Absolutely, I can check that for you. Let me see if we have a technician available today who can come out and help. Meanwhile, is there a time today that would work best for you if we do need to send someone over?

Turn 39 (learner):
  “Could you check if there is an outage in the area?”

Turn 40 (bot):
  Sure, I can definitely do that. Let me quickly check if there's an outage reported in your area. Just give me a moment. In the meantime, if there's anything else that comes to mind about the problem, feel free to let me know.

Turn 41 (learner):
  “What should I try before you send someone?”

Turn 42 (bot):
  Yeah, of course! One last thing you might try is just restarting the device itself, like your computer or phone, and then reconnecting. But if that doesn't help, I'll definitely line up a technician for you. So let me know if that restart helps at all.

Turn 43 (learner):
  “Okay, but should I wait here, or will someone call me?”

Turn 44 (bot):
  Sure, you can just hang tight here for a moment, and I'll let you know what I find. So no worries, I'll give you the update right here. And if we do need to send someone, I'll let you know how that’ll work. Sound good?

Turn 45 (learner):
  “Good.”

Turn 46 (bot):
  Great! All right, I’ll just check that outage info and we’ll figure things out from there. So just sit tight, and I’ll let you know in a sec if we need to send someone or if there’s an update.

Turn 47 (learner):
  “Okay.”

Turn 48 (bot):
  All right, perfect! So I’m checking that for you now. Just give me a moment and I’ll let you know what I find. In the meantime, just relax and I’ll keep you posted in just a sec.

Turn 49 (learner):
  “Yes, okay, I will to wait you.”

Turn 50 (bot):
  All right, thanks for your patience! I’ll let you know as soon as I’ve got that info. So just hang tight for a moment and I’ll get right back to you.

Turn 51 (learner):
  “OK.”

Turn 52 (bot):
  Great! So I’ve checked and it looks like there actually is a small outage in your area, which might explain the problem. We’re already working on it, and it should be fixed in a few hours. If you still have issues after that, just let us know and we can send someone out. Anything else I can help with?

Turn 53 (learner):
  “Who can I contact if this isn't resolved today?”

Turn 54 (bot):
  Sure! If it’s not resolved today, you can just contact us again at this same support line and we’ll be happy to help. We’re here 24/7, so just reach out if you need anything else.

Turn 55 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you.”

Turn 56 (bot):
  You're very welcome! If you need anything else, just let me know. Otherwise, I hope your internet is back up and running soon. Thanks for calling and have a great day!

Turn 57 (learner):
  “I hope you have a great day, too.”

Turn 58 (bot):
  Thank you so much! I appreciate that. All right, well, if there's nothing else, feel free to reach out anytime. Have a lovely day!

Turn 59 (learner):
  “You, too.”

Turn 60 (bot):
  Thanks a lot! Take care and I’ll be here if you need anything else. Have a good one! Task 2: Reporting a Lost Item or Filing a Minor Police Report Now you will be working as an officer at a police station. I need to report the loss of my wallet. tham, I have just arrived at the police station and you will be assisting me.

Turn 61 (bot):
  Of course. [sound of papers shuffling] Good afternoon. I’m Officer Daniels — I’ll help you with your report today. Can you tell me when you first noticed your wallet was missing?

Turn 62 (learner):
  “Bye, Daniels.”

Turn 63 (bot):
  Hi there! All right, let’s get started. So just let me know roughly when you realized your wallet went missing, and we’ll take it from there.

Turn 64 (learner):
  “Last night, I have been in a pub. When I paid my account, I remember I put my wallet in my pocket. But after that, when I arrived in my house, my wallet didn't stay in my pocket.”

Turn 65 (bot):
  Got it. So it sounds like it might have gone missing sometime between the pub and getting home. Let me ask: do you remember which pub you were at, just so we have that on record?

Turn 66 (learner):
  “The name is IveClub.”

Turn 67 (bot):
  All right, thanks for

Turn 68 (learner):
  “I remember when I left the pub, I met some girls and I hugged the girls.”

Turn 69 (bot):
  All right, that’s

Turn 70 (learner):
  “beautiful girls, but I just talked together some time. I took it just some time. And after that, I leave it. And when I arrived in my house, didn't my wallet.”

Turn 71 (bot):
  Got it, that makes sense. So you chatted with them for a bit and then headed home. All right, we’ll note that down. Now, just to be thorough, do you remember if you noticed anyone acting suspicious or if you think the wallet might have fallen out somewhere along the way?

Turn 72 (learner):
  “I think no, but in my wallet, there's my driver's license and my MasterCard and $50 or $60.”

Turn 73 (bot):
  All right, thanks for letting me know what was inside. That's definitely helpful for the report. So we'll note down your driver’s license, your MasterCard, and about 50 to 60 dollars in cash. Now, we'll go ahead and file this and keep an eye out. Is there anything else you’d like to add before we wrap it up?

Turn 74 (learner):
  “Could you check in the pub if any wallet was found in the place?”

Turn 75 (bot):
  Absolutely, I can do that for you. I'll give the pub a quick call and see if anyone turned in a wallet matching your description. In the meantime, we'll have all your details on file here. Just hang tight and I’ll let you know what they say.

Turn 76 (learner):
  “Okay, I have more details. This wallet is black, it's the high-fired Heliosphere, the brain's Heliosphere, and there is a blue in the headline around this wallet.”

Turn 77 (bot):
  Perfect, that’s really helpful. So a black Tommy Hilfiger wallet with a blue outline detail—got it. I'll mention those specifics when I give them a call, and hopefully that helps track it down. Let me do that real quick and I’ll get back to you.

Turn 78 (learner):
  “OK. I will try.”

Turn 79 (bot):
  All right, thanks for waiting just a bit. I'll make that call and we’ll see what they say. Sit tight and I’ll be right back with an update.

Turn 80 (learner):
  “Could you repeat, please?”

Turn 81 (bot):
  Of course! I’m just saying I’ll give them a quick call now and see if they’ve found your wallet. So just hang on for a moment and I’ll let you know what I find out.

Turn 82 (learner):
  “OK.”

Turn 83 (bot):
  All right, thanks! I’ll handle that and get right back to you. Just a moment and we’ll see what they say.

Turn 84 (learner):
  “Okay, I'm waiting.”

Turn 85 (bot):
  Perfect, I appreciate your patience! I’ll go ahead and check in with them now. Just give me a second and I’ll let you know as soon as I hear back.

Turn 86 (learner):
  “Did you check?”

Turn 87 (bot):
  I sure did. So I just got off the phone with them, and unfortunately, they didn't find any wallet matching that description at the pub. But no worries, we've got all the details in the report here, and if anything turns up, we’ll let you know. Let me know if there's anything else you need!

Turn 88 (learner):
  “Oh, really?”

Turn 89 (bot):
  Yeah, unfortunately,

Turn 90 (learner):
  “Oh, it's so bad for me.”

Turn 91 (bot):
  I understand, it’s definitely frustrating to lose something like that. We’ll keep the report on file, and if anything comes up, we’ll let you know. In the meantime, if you need anything else, just let me know.

Turn 92 (learner):
  “What happens next if we finish it here?”

Turn 93 (bot):
  Absolutely. So from here, we’ve got everything noted down and we’ll keep an eye out. If anything turns up, we’ll contact you. Otherwise, you’re all set and we’re done here. Thanks for coming in, and take care!

Turn 94 (learner):
  “I have another question. What happens if a 7-1-1 finds it?”

Turn 95 (bot):
  Sure, that's a good question. If someone finds it and turns it in, we'll contact you right away so you can come pick it up. In the meantime, if you have any updates or if you find it yourself, just let us know.

Turn 96 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you so much. I will check back tomorrow again.”

Turn 97 (bot):
  You're very welcome! Feel free to check back anytime. We'll be here if you need anything else. Have a good day, and we’ll see you tomorrow if you need to follow up.

Turn 98 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you. I appreciate your attendance, and I hope you have a very good day.”
