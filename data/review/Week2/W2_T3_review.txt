REPAIR DETAILS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repair 1:
  Turns: [15, 16]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: lexical error – 'bound' instead of 'bond'
  Evidence: The learner used the incorrect word 'bound' in turn 15. The bot implicitly corrected this to 'bond' in its response in turn 16 and provided a relevant answer, indicating successful understanding and resolution.

  Turn Content:

Repair 2:
  Turns: [21, 22, 23, 24]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: ambiguous reference – 'the third day'
  Evidence: The learner's reference to 'the third day' in turn 21 was ambiguous. The bot's response in turn 22 was generic and did not fully address the ambiguity. The learner then clarified their intent in turn 23 by explaining they wanted to visit twice (morning and evening), which the bot successfully understood and confirmed in turn 24, resolving the initial ambiguity.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 21 (learner): “So, on the third day, the whole day is okay, right?”...
    Turn 22 (bot): Yes, absolutely! I’ll make sure to schedule the viewing at a time that’s most convenient for you dur...
    Turn 23 (learner): “Because I want to see the situation both in the morning and in the evening, so may I come twice to ...

Repair 3:
  Turns: [29, 30]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: lexical error – 'signal the lease' instead of 'sign the lease'
  Evidence: The learner used the incorrect phrase 'signal the lease' in turn 29. The bot implicitly corrected this to 'sign the lease' in its response in turn 30 and provided a relevant answer, indicating successful understanding and resolution.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 29 (learner): “Do I pay the bond before signal the lease?”...
    Turn 30 (bot): Typically, the bond is paid once your application is approved and before you sign the lease. But I’l...


Repair 4:
  Turns: [37, 38]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: lexical error – 'break the list early' instead of 'break the lease early'
  Evidence: The learner used the incorrect phrase 'break the list early' in turn 37. The bot implicitly corrected this to 'breaking the lease early' in its response in turn 38 and provided a relevant answer, indicating successful understanding and resolution.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 37 (learner): “If I break the list early, what are the consequences?”...
    Turn 38 (bot): That's a great question! Usually, there might be a notice period and possibly a fee for breaking the...

Turn 1 (learner):
  “This time, I'm calling you to ask about a rental property.”

Turn 21 (learner):
  “So, on the third day, the whole day is okay, right?”

Turn 22 (bot):
  Yes, absolutely! I’ll make sure to schedule the viewing at a time that’s most convenient for you during the day. I’ll confirm everything in the email, and we’ll make it super easy for you!

Turn 23 (learner):
  “Because I want to see the situation both in the morning and in the evening, so may I come twice to attend?”

Turn 24 (bot):
  Of course, that sounds totally fine! You’re welcome to come by both in the morning and in the evening to get a full sense of the place. I’ll make sure everything is arranged for both visits!

Turn 25 (learner):
  “That's great, thank you. And I'm also interested in another unit just beside it, and could I apply for both?”

Turn 26 (bot):
  Absolutely, you can definitely apply for both! I'll make sure to include all the details for that second unit as well. We’ll get everything sorted so you have all the options you need!

Turn 27 (learner):
  “If someone else also applies, how will you choose?”

Turn 28 (bot):
  If there are multiple applicants, I’ll make sure to keep you updated on the status, and we can go from there. I’ll do my best to make the process as smooth and transparent as possible for you!

Turn 29 (learner):
  “Do I pay the bond before signal the lease?”

Turn 31 (learner):
  “So is it okay to email a copy of my ID?”

Turn 32 (bot):
  Yes, absolutely! You can email a copy of your ID, and I'll make sure everything is kept secure. If you have any other documents or questions, just let me know!

Turn 33 (learner):
  “I remember I don't have rental history in Australia, so can I still apply?”

Turn 34 (bot):
  Absolutely, you can still apply! We can consider other factors like your employment details and personal references. I’ll make sure the process is as smooth as possible for you!

Turn 35 (learner):
  “Is my passport okay to apply?”

Turn 36 (bot):
  Absolutely, that should be perfectly fine! We'll take everything into account and make the application as smooth as possible. If there's anything else you need, just let me know!

Turn 37 (learner):
  “If I break the list early, what are the consequences?”

Turn 38 (bot):
  That's a great question! Usually, there might be a notice period and possibly a fee for breaking the lease early. I’ll get the exact details for you and include them in the email so you have a clear understanding.

Turn 39 (learner):
  “OK, so every important things and details will in the email to me, right?”

Turn 40 (bot):
  Exactly! I'll make sure to include all the important details in the email so you have everything you need in one place. If you have any other questions, just let me know!

Turn 41 (learner):
  “No, thank you, that's all.”

Turn 42 (bot):
