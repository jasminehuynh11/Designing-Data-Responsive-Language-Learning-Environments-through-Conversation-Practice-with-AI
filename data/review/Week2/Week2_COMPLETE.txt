REPAIR DETAILS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repair 1:
  Turns: [7, 8, 9]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner did not understand bot's previous utterance
  Evidence: The learner explicitly states 'Sorry, I didn't catch you' in turn 7, indicating a lack of understanding of the bot's previous question. The bot rephrases its question in turn 8, and the learner responds appropriately in turn 9, showing the issue was resolved.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 7 [LEARNER]: “Sorry, I didn't catch you.”...
    Turn 8 [BOT]: No worries at all! I was just asking if you have a preferred date or time for your appointment, so w...
    Turn 9 [LEARNER]: “I just want as soon as possible because my toothache is a little bit heavy.”...


Repair 2:
  Turns: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: unclear phrasing – learner's awkward questions about time
  Evidence: The learner uses awkward phrasing like 'up-to-date time' (turn 11) and 'period time' (turn 13) to inquire about the appointment time. The bot successfully interprets the learner's intent to find the earliest available time (turn 12) and then provides a specific period (turn 14), which the learner accepts in turn 15, resolving the communication trouble stemming from the learner's phrasing.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 11 [LEARNER]: “When is the up-to-date time to the appointment?”...
    Turn 12 [BOT]: Let me quickly check that for you. I’ll find the earliest available time and let you know in just a ...
    Turn 13 [LEARNER]: “So, which is the period time?”...
    Turn 14 [BOT]: Alright, I’ve found an appointment available later today in the afternoon. Does that work for you?...
    Turn 15 [LEARNER]: “Oh, yes?”...


Repair 3:
  Turns: [17, 18, 19]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: bot omission – bot did not provide specific time
  Evidence: After the bot mentioned an appointment 'later today in the afternoon' (turn 14), the learner explicitly asks for the specific time in turn 17. The bot provides the exact time (3 PM) in turn 18, and the learner confirms understanding in turn 19, resolving the missing information.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 17 [LEARNER]: “Sorry, but what time is it?”...
    Turn 18 [BOT]: The appointment is scheduled for 3 PM this afternoon. I hope that works perfectly for you!...
    Turn 19 [LEARNER]: “Okay, that's okay.”...


Repair 4:
  Turns: [23, 24]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner clarification – adding a new preference/constraint
  Evidence: The learner introduces a new preference for a female dentist in turn 23, which could potentially affect the previously discussed booking. The bot acknowledges and confirms it will accommodate this request in turn 24, resolving the potential issue and moving forward with the updated preference.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 23 [LEARNER]: “Sorry, but I want a female dentist. I'm a little bit shy.”...
    Turn 24 [BOT]: Of course, I totally understand. I'll make sure to schedule you with a female dentist. I'll confirm ...


Repair 5:
  Turns: [27, 28]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: unclear phrasing – learner's awkward question about arrival time
  Evidence: The learner uses the awkward phrasing 'more earlier' in turn 27 to ask about an earlier arrival time for the newly arranged check-up. The bot correctly interprets this as a request for an earlier check-up and confirms it will try to arrange it in turn 28, successfully resolving the communication despite the learner's phrasing.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 27 [LEARNER]: “So will I get to the hospital more earlier?”...
    Turn 28 [BOT]: I can definitely try to arrange an earlier check-up for you. I'll see what's available and let you k...


Repair 6:
  Turns: [35, 36]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: fragmented/unclear phrasing – learner's grammatically incorrect and fragmented question
  Evidence: The learner's utterance in turn 35 is highly fragmented and grammatically incorrect, making it difficult to understand their question about what to do if they don't receive the email. The bot successfully interprets the underlying intent and provides a clear solution in turn 36, resolving the communication trouble.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 35 [LEARNER]: “But as soon as I went to a restaurant to meet my friend, so what will I do when I didn't well, I ha...
    Turn 36 [BOT]: No worries at all! If you don't receive the email right away, just let me know and I'll resend it to...


Repair 7:
  Turns: [39, 40, 41]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: learner misunderstanding – misunderstanding bot's identity/capabilities
  Evidence: The learner asks for the bot's personal number in turn 39, indicating a misunderstanding of the bot's nature as an AI. The bot clarifies its role and offers the clinic's phone number instead in turn 40, which the learner accepts in turn 41, resolving the misunderstanding.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 39 [LEARNER]: “Would you give me your number?”...
    Turn 40 [BOT]: I’m here to help you anytime through our chat or email, but if you need the clinic's phone number, I...
    Turn 41 [LEARNER]: “That's fine.”...
