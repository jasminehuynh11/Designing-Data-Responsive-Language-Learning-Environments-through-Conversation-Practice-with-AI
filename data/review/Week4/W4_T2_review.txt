Repair 1:
  Turns: [16, 17, 18]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: bot omission – incomplete utterance
  Evidence: The bot's utterance in turn 16 was incomplete ('like the University of'). The learner in turn 17 recognized this and completed the sentence by listing specific universities (Oxford, Cambridge, UCL), then offered to elaborate. The bot accepted this offer in turn 18, indicating the trouble was resolved and understanding was achieved.

    Turn 17 (learner): Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and UCL. If you want, we can dive into more details about any o...
    Turn 18 (bot): Yes, please. How different between each university?...


Repair 2:
  Turns: [43, 44, 45, 46]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: bot misunderstanding – misinterpretation of learner's intent
  Evidence: In turn 43, the learner stated 'I think we should present first.' The bot in turn 44 misinterpreted this as the learner volunteering for the first part ('So you’ll take the first part'). The learner implicitly initiated a repair in turn 45 by stating 'This part feels too difficult for me. Can I swap with someone else?', clarifying their original intent. The bot acknowledged and offered a solution in turn 46, resolving the misunderstanding.

    Turn 45 (learner): This part feels too difficult for me. Can I swap with someone else?...
    Turn 46 (bot): Of course, we can definitely do that. We can find someone whose strengths match that section better....

Turn 1 (learner):
  Hi, I want to study overseas in the future. Could you tell me how to prepare now?

Turn 2 (bot):
  Absolutely! Studying overseas is exciting. To get started, one of the first steps is deciding on a destination. Do you have a particular country or university in mind?

Turn 3 (learner):
  I would like to go abroad to the U.K.

Turn 4 (bot):
  Oh, the UK is a great choice! Alright, so the next step is to look at the universities and the programs that interest you. Do you already have a field of study in mind?

Turn 5 (learner):
  No, I don’t.

Turn 6 (bot):
  No worries at all! That gives you a bit of flexibility. So, the next step would be exploring different fields that interest you. Are there any subjects that you find particularly exciting?

Turn 7 (learner):
  I'm interested in studying for education at the moment.

Turn 8 (bot):
  That’s wonderful! Education is such a meaningful field. So, the next step would be to look at universities in the UK that have strong education programs. Do you need any help with that?

Turn 9 (learner):
  Yes, please.

Turn 10 (bot):
  Absolutely! I’d be happy to help. So, we can start by looking at some top universities known for education studies, and we can also talk about entry requirements and application timelines. Does that sound good to you?

Turn 11 (learner):
  I want to improve my English in education industries.

Turn 12 (bot):
  Got it! Focusing on English skills for the education field is a great idea. We can work on specific vocabulary and phrases that you’ll need. Are you looking for general English practice, or more specific areas, like academic writing?

Turn 13 (learner):
  I think make a foundation would be great, so I would like to learn general English at first.

Turn 14 (bot):
  Great! We can definitely build a solid foundation in general English. We’ll focus on communication skills, vocabulary, and grammar that will be useful for the education sector. So, let’s get started with some basics!

Turn 15 (learner):
  Do you have any recommendation for studying education in the UK?

Turn 16 (bot):
  Sure! There are quite a few renowned universities in the UK for education, like the University of

Turn 17 (learner):
  Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and UCL. If you want, we can dive into more details about any of them!

Turn 18 (bot):
  Yes, please. How different between each university?

Turn 19 (learner):
  Absolutely! Each university has its own unique strengths. For example, Oxford and Cambridge are known for their long history and prestigious reputation, while UCL is known for its diverse and innovative approach. We can explore their specific programs if you’d like!

Turn 20 (bot):
  Could you explain the specific programs of Oxford?

Turn 21 (learner):
  Absolutely! Oxford has a fantastic Department of Education with a wide range of programs, from master’s degrees in comparative and international education to doctoral programs focusing on educational policy. They also emphasize research and offer a vibrant academic community.

Turn 22 (bot):
  Should I do a diploma before a master's degree?

Turn 23 (learner):
  It really depends on your background and the program requirements. Some master’s programs do prefer a diploma or some professional experience, but others might accept you directly. If you’d like, we can look into the specific entry criteria for the program you’re interested in.

Turn 24 (bot):
  How is the diploma different from the master's degree?

Turn 25 (learner):
  A diploma is usually a shorter program and often more focused on practical skills, whereas a master’s degree is more in-depth and research-oriented. The diploma can sometimes be a good stepping stone if you want to build some foundational knowledge before diving into a master’s.

Turn 26 (bot):
  OK, and I really want to study for education, but what are some signs that a course or subject might not be the right fit for me?

Turn 27 (learner):
  That’s a great question! Some signs might include feeling uninterested or unmotivated by the coursework, struggling with the material even after giving it a good effort, or not seeing how the subject aligns with your long-term goals. It’s always good to reflect on how you feel about the subject as you dive in.

Turn 28 (bot):
  How can I stay motivated if I'm not sure about my goals yet?

Turn 29 (learner):
  Staying motivated can definitely be challenging, but one great way is to set small, manageable goals and celebrate those little achievements along the way. Also, exploring different areas within the field can help you find what excites you. And don’t forget to connect with peers or mentors for support and inspiration.

Turn 30 (bot):
  Also, what types of jobs are common for people in my degree?

Turn 31 (learner):
  With a degree in education, there are quite a few career paths you can take! Common roles include teaching, educational consulting, curriculum development, and even administrative positions in schools or educational organizations. It really depends on what interests you the most!

Turn 32 (bot):
  Who else can I talk to for career or study advice at the university?

Turn 33 (learner):
  At Oxford, you can reach out to academic advisors in the Department of Education, as well as career services that specialize in helping students with career planning. You can also connect with professors who have similar interests and even alumni who can share their experiences.

Turn 34 (bot):
  That’s great. Are there any new industries or roles I should consider based on my strengths?

Turn 35 (learner):
  Absolutely, there are always new and emerging fields. For instance, educational technology is growing rapidly, and roles in that sector could be a great fit. Also, educational consulting, policy analysis, and even roles in online education are really on the rise. It all depends on what you’re passionate about!

Turn 36 (bot):
  Thanks for your time. I'll look into those options.

Turn 37 (learner):
  You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. Feel free to reach out anytime if you have more questions. Good luck with everything, and have a great day!

Turn 38 (bot):
  Hi. We have just started our group project. Can we plan the task together? Because we need to choose the presentation order. What do you think works best?

Turn 39 (learner):
  Absolutely, that sounds like a great idea! It’s always helpful to get everyone on the same page.

Turn 40 (bot):
  Maybe we can start by listing out all the tasks and then decide who’s best at what. Does that sound good to you?

Turn 41 (learner):
  Yeah,sounds great.

Turn 42 (bot):
  Awesome! So let’s start by listing out the main sections of the presentation. Do you have any particular areas you feel more comfortable with?

Turn 43 (learner):
  I think we should present first, so we have more time to write.

Turn 44 (bot):
  Got it, that makes sense! So you’ll take the first part. What about the rest of the team? Do you have any preferences on who might handle the next sections?

Turn 45 (learner):
  This part feels too difficult for me. Can I swap with someone else?

Turn 46 (bot):
  Of course, we can definitely do that. We can find someone whose strengths match that section better. Do you have a particular person in mind, or should we just discuss it with the group?

Turn 47 (learner):
  Let's discuss with the group.

Turn 48 (bot):
  Sounds like a plan! It’s always best to get everyone’s input. So, let’s gather the team and have a quick chat about it. Anything else you’d like to cover?

Turn 49 (learner):
  I'm happy to try the presentation, but I've never done it before. Any tips?

Turn 50 (bot):
  Absolutely! Just remember to keep it simple and practice a bit. Also, focusing on your key points and making eye contact will help a lot. And I’m here to help if you need any more tips!

Turn 51 (learner):
  I see your point. Does anyone have experience with this type of project we could learn from each other?

Turn 52 (bot):
  That’s a great idea! I’m sure someone in the group has some experience. Let’s do a quick round and see who can share their insights. Sound good?

Turn 53 (learner):
  Yes, perfect! How do we make sure everyone is doing their part fairly?

Turn 54 (bot):
  That’s an important question! We can set clear deadlines and have regular check-ins, maybe even a shared document so everyone can update their progress. That way, we can all stay on track and support each other.

Turn 55 (learner):
  That's great. Do you think we need a shared document to manage tasks?

Turn 56 (bot):
  I think it could definitely help! It keeps everything transparent and easy to access for everyone.

Turn 57 (learner):
  We can set one up and see how it goes!

Turn 58 (bot):
  Great, thank you. Can I take notes while someone else presents?

Turn 59 (learner):
  Absolutely, that would be really helpful! That way, we can all focus on the content and you’ll have a solid record of everything. Sounds like a plan!

Turn 60 (bot):
  Should we check in every few days to stay on track?

Turn 61 (learner):
  I think that would be a great idea! A quick check-in every few days can help everyone stay accountable and address any issues early on. Let’s do that!

Turn 62 (bot):
  Let's message each other if we run into problems.

Turn 63 (learner):
  Absolutely, that’s a perfect approach! Keeping communication open will make everything run smoothly. I’m sure you’ll all do great!

Turn 64 (bot):
  If someone can't meet the deadline, how should we handle that?

Turn 65 (learner):
  It’s always good to approach it with understanding and support. We can offer help or adjust the workload if needed, and make sure everyone feels comfortable asking for extensions if necessary. It’s all about teamwork!

Turn 66 (bot):
  So we are all agree at the moment?

Turn 67 (learner):
  Absolutely, it sounds like you’ve got a solid plan in place! I’m sure your project is going to go really well. If you need anything else, just let me know!

Turn 68 (bot):
  Let’s discuss again if we were in trouble.

Turn 69 (learner):
  That sounds like a great plan! I’m here whenever you need to chat again. Good luck with everything, and I’m sure it’s going to be a success!

Turn 70 (bot):
  Yes, we got this.

Turn 71 (learner):
  Absolutely, you definitely do! I’m cheering you on, and I know you’ll do great. Just reach out anytime you need!

Turn 72 (bot):
  Thank you for your time!

Turn 73 (learner):
  Got it! Well, I’m glad we could chat, and I wish you the best with your project. Take care, and feel free to reach out anytime.
