REPAIR DETAILS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repair 1:
  Turns: [3, 4]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: contextual error – incorrect time for 'tonight'
  Evidence: The learner requests a table for 'tonight' at '7 a.m.' (T3). The bot identifies the logical inconsistency and corrects the time to '7 p.m.' (T4), which the learner implicitly accepts as the conversation continues with the corrected time.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 3 (learner): “Do you have a table available at 7 a.m.?”...
    Turn 4 (bot): Let me check that for you! For tonight at 7 p.m., we do have availability for two. Would you like a ...


Repair 2:
  Turns: [17, 18]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: lexical error – 'bookie' instead of 'booking/reservation'
  Evidence: The learner uses the incorrect word 'bookie' (T17). The bot understands the intended meaning and implicitly corrects it by using 'reservation' (T18), which the learner accepts by continuing the conversation without further clarification.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 17 (learner): “Okay, sorry, can I add another person to the bookie?”...
    Turn 18 (bot): Of course, no problem at all! Just let me know how many people you'd like to add, and I'll update th...


Repair 3:
  Turns: [23, 24]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: unclear phrasing – fragmented grammar about allergies
  Evidence: The learner's utterance about their friend's allergy is grammatically fragmented and potentially confusing (T23). The bot demonstrates understanding by rephrasing and confirming the specific allergy (mango) and offering accommodation (T24), resolving the ambiguity.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 23 (learner): “Okay, thank you. Because my friend is, next Monday, my friend is, is allergy for, she is allergic t...
    Turn 24 (bot): Of course, I completely understand. We'll make sure to keep that in mind and ensure that there are n...


Repair 4:
  Turns: [25, 26]
  Initiation: BI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: phonetic/lexical error – 'whitelist' instead of 'wine list'
  Evidence: The learner asks to see the 'whitelist' (T25). The bot correctly interprets this as 'wine list' (T26) and offers to send it, resolving the phonetic/lexical confusion.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 25 (learner): “And for tonight and next Monday, can I see the whitelist in advance?”...
    Turn 26 (bot): Absolutely! I can definitely send you the wine list in advance so you can take a look and choose you...


Repair 5:
  Turns: [35, 37, 38]
  Initiation: LI
  Resolution: R
  Trigger: self-correction – learner changes intent/confirms after saying they couldn't
  Evidence: The learner initially asks if someone could call them later if they 'can't confirm the set menu now' (T35). However, in T37, the learner self-corrects by stating 'For now, I'm just ordering for a set meal for two people.' The bot acknowledges this new information and proceeds (T38), indicating the self-correction was understood and accepted.

  Turn Content:
    Turn 35 (learner): “Okay, so if I can't confirm the set menu now, would somebody be able to call me later today?”...
    Turn 37 (learner): “For now, I'm just ordering for a set meal for two people.”...
    Turn 38 (bot): Got it! That sounds great. I’ll make sure everything is arranged for the set meal for two, and if yo...
