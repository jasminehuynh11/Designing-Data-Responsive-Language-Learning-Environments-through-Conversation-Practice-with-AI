Turn 1 (learner):
  Task three

Turn 2 (learner):
  Hello, I bought this shirt last week but it doesn’t fit. I have the receipt here. So, could I exchange it for a smaller size?”

Turn 3 (learner):
  “Thank you. Because it is too large for me and I think there is a little bit stain in the sleeve.”

Turn 4 (learner):
  “Okay, so I want to ask more further information, like how many days do I have to return an item?”

Turn 5 (learner):
  “Okay, so, okay, let me take a look. So, can I exchange this for something else in the same price range?”

Turn 6 (learner):
  “Okay, let me take a look around the shop.”

Turn 7 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you.”

Turn 8 (learner):
  “OK, then.”

Turn 9 (learner):
  “Oh, if I buy this as a, yes, I take this out, maybe I think this is better. And if I buy this as a gift, can the person return it without a receipt?”

Turn 10 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you. And my husband bought another jumper in the shop and I noticed a loose seam. Could you fix it here or should I return it?”

Turn 11 (learner):
  “Okay, so can I return this if I've already taken off the tax?”

Turn 12 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you. And...”

Turn 13 (learner):
  “Yes, I bought this”

Turn 14 (learner):
  “I bought this electronic device on your online shop. And what happens if the item is damaged when I open it?”

Turn 15 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you. And of course, because this is near Christmas, right, so do you offer extended returns for Christmas purchases?”

Turn 16 (learner):
  “That's perfect. Thank you very much, and I'm so sorry for asking so many questions.”

Turn 17 (learner):
  “Okay, thank you, and I appreciate you explaining that policy, and thanks for your help. See you!”
