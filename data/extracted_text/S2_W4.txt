Task 1 Career discussion
You said: 
“Hi, Professor Tonic. Did you have a moment? I need to talk to you.”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Of course, absolutely.
You said:
“about my career.”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, take your time. I'm here to help, so feel free to tell me all about your career situation and we’ll chat it through.
You said:
“Like, now I'm 34 years old, the class, the old one in my class, a student, and I just worry about that I can't find a job from Australia because what I'm studying is management of business. I just worry about that I can't find a good job in Australia.”
00:50
ChatGPT said:
I understand. Well, first of all, it's absolutely okay to have those worries, especially when you're balancing studies a bit later than some of your classmates. So, let’s take it step by step. We can definitely talk through how you can use your business management studies and what kind of career paths you might have in Australia. And we’ll figure out some practical next steps for you, all right?
You said:
“I could understand what did you say, could you just slowly and get a simple explain that, please?”
00:11
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I’m happy to slow it down and keep it simple. So, in short: it’s completely normal to feel that way. We can talk together about how your business management studies can help you find a good job here. We’ll figure out some next steps together.
You said:
“Okay, recently I had a job, it's a local company and they're searching one guy who can join the frock league but I didn't get a license so they might think about changing me, buy me or something, but recently the management just talked to me that I got the management position of the business MBA with me and I'm a little bit confused about that.”
00:49
ChatGPT said:
Sure, I understand. Let’s break it down simply. So, you had a local company that was interested in you, and they wanted someone who could maybe drive as part of the job. And you were worried because you don't have a license, so you were thinking, "Oh, maybe they'll replace me or something." But now it sounds like management is actually talking to you about your business management degree or your MBA and what that means. So we can talk about how that fits in and what steps you can take next.
You said:
“I just want to note, because I didn't answer my management, so I need to be honest to my management, because I didn't get the proper licenses, but if I didn't get the management of business, the master, I'm afraid they might fire me, so I should be honest to my management. That's what I want to ask.”
00:37
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I understand. So yes, being honest with your management is a good idea. You can definitely let them know that you don't have a driver's license right now, but also highlight that you do have your business management degree and that you're eager to contribute in that area. So just being open and honest can actually help them see where you fit best, and it can help you feel a lot more comfortable.
You said:
“Yes, thank you. Thank you for your advice. But right now, because I have the school holidays, like Friday is the ERP. But I want to know that, should I just still studying at uni? Because in my age, I'm over 13.”
00:39
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I hear
You said:
“conversion, lots of things.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and that's completely understandable. So to put it simply: yes, it’s absolutely okay to still be studying at university at your age. There’s no age limit on learning, and a lot of people go back to study at different stages in life. So during your school holidays, if you want to use that time to study a bit more or just to relax, that’s completely fine. Just go at your own pace and know that it's perfectly normal.
You said:
“But I didn't tell you all the whole things that I didn't get passed in the first final test. The teachers just told me about that if next time I didn't get the whole pass, I might need to recite the whole star in the A2D, I think.”
00:32
ChatGPT said:
I see, that makes sense. So, first of all, thanks for sharing that. It's definitely important to know the full picture. And it's okay if you didn't pass that first final test. A lot of people have to try again. So, if that happens and you do need to re-sit or restart a portion, that's okay. We can talk about how to prepare for that and just take it one step at a time. You’re definitely not alone in that.
You said:
“Thank you for your advice. Yes, I think I do need to start harder, but I do take a lot of time for the starting, so I still can get a good mark. So that's kind of made me mad, I think.”
00:29
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and it’s completely understandable to feel a little frustrated. You’re putting in a lot of time and effort, and it’s okay to feel that way. The important thing is just to take it step by step, and we can definitely find ways to help you study a bit more effectively or manage your time so that you feel more confident. But don’t worry, it’s totally normal, and you’re doing just fine.
You said:
“Thank you, you're so kind.”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely welcome!

ChatGPT said:
And if you ever need more advice or just want to chat things through, I’m always here to help.
You said:
“Professor, what should I do to the next step? I need your advice about that. Thank you.”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
Of course, I'm happy to help you figure out your next steps. So from here, I’d say let’s focus on two things. First, you can make a simple plan for how you’ll prepare for that next test—just a bit of a study routine that’s manageable for you. And second, have an honest conversation with your management about what you can bring to the role with your business degree. Just these small steps will help you move forward.
You said:
“Thank you, thank you BitHouse.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help out, and just remember to take it one step at a time. You've got this!
You said:
“Thank you for your advice.”

ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely welcome! It was my pleasure to help, and take care. See you next time!

Task 2 Discuss Research Task
Me: Hey, we just start our growth process. Can we plan the tags together?
AI: Absolutely, let’s do it! We can break down the project into smaller tasks and set some deadlines. Do you have any specific areas you want to focus on, or should we just brainstorm together?
Me: And did you know, this is a Wi-Fi project presentation, and this is the final work in this week. And last week, we already decided the infographic and robot design, and it can help avoid cancer. People can get the treatment.
AI: That sounds like a really impactful project! So it seems like we already have a solid foundation with the infographic and the robot design. We can plan out the content for the presentation, assign different sections, and set some milestones. Let me know how you’d like
AI: Awesome! Just let me know what you’d like to tackle first, and we can get started on planning it all out together!
Me: Yes, yes. And I'm gonna go to the first speech to introduction, and you're gonna tell about more detail and data information. And another, Maggie gonna tell about the robots how gonna work, how gonna work and deal with boy cancer.
AI: Perfect! That sounds like a solid plan. I’ll make sure to support you with the detailed data and information for your part, and Maggie can take care of the robot details. Just let me know if there’s anything specific you need!
Me: I think, I think, because I know recently, Australia singer and actors, with second I just can't remember the news.
AI: Got it! It sounds like you’ve got a recent piece of news in mind about an Australian singer and actor. If you want, we can definitely chat about that or incorporate it into our project if it’s relevant!
Me: Oh, I remember the details. In the first, my speech, I'm going to tell about the Ben Levis, the Australian actor and singer. And because he sadly passed away at the age of 46 from the bowel cancer, and he's the shocking many in the performing arts community. And I think this is the best way for the beginning. And then it can remind anyone that disease can affect anyone, no matter how healthy, active, or successful they appear to be. What do you think?
AI: I think that’s a really impactful and compassionate way to start your speech. It definitely sets the tone and makes the issue feel very real and relatable. I’m sure it’ll resonate with your audience. If you need any help with the details or the transition into the next section, just let me know!
AI: Yes, I do know about ostomy bags! They are medical devices that help patients who have had certain types of surgeries related to the digestive system. It’s definitely an important and often overlooked aspect of living with certain health conditions, so it sounds like a really meaningful topic to include in your speech.
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just scared when I speak, then no one answers me. So when I mentioned about the Ostermer back, so please, you can tell the details to the classmates, please.
AI: Absolutely, I’ve got your back! If there’s a pause or if the audience needs a bit more detail, I’ll jump in and explain it clearly. I’m sure you’ll do great, and we’ll make sure everything flows smoothly!
Me: And this is my point, this is my opinion, and I'm kind of a bit worried about the times, because we only had, everyone had three minutes to talk about the presentation. So, when I finished this speech, and you are the next to talk about the information, did you have any idea about this part?
AI: Got it! I’ll keep my part concise and to the point so we stay within the time limit. And if you ever need a quick recap or any help with the timing, just let me know. We’ll make sure everything fits perfectly!
Me: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have great ideas. Did you think in the end, when Maggie's speech, after Maggie's speech, then we can, in conclusion together, talk about bowel cancers, the theory, how serious they are, and then, and our robots can, hope our robots decide can fix this problem. What do you think?
AI: I think that’s a fantastic idea! It will bring everything full circle and leave the audience with a strong, unified message. We’ll make sure that conclusion really drives home the impact of the project. Sounds like a solid plan!
Me: And did you think before we in presentation to anyone, should we just need to practice together before the presentation test?
AI: Absolutely, practicing together is a great idea! It helps everyone get comfortable with their parts, and you can fine-tune the transitions and timing. Plus, it’s a great confidence booster. So let’s definitely plan a practice session before the actual presentation!
AI: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So sad that Maggie got sick today. And you must let Maggie prepare the speech about his path for the robot design. And as we talked about before, the robots had the different skill where he had X eyes and his right hand can turn into the treatment. And I've just forgot a lot of other parts. Please just remind Maggie to have more idea about the robots. And before Maggie's speech, we must know more about the robot's design details. Because Maggie promised us that he do the robot design part.
AI: Got it! I’ll make sure to remind Maggie about those details and the importance of having everything ready for the presentation. I hope she feels better soon, and we’ll make sure everything is on track for the group!
Me: Okay, see you tomorrow, the final presentations work, I like to work with you guys, and you are the best group for me, and goodbye, see you.
AI: Thank you so much! I really appreciate that, and I’m always here to help. Good luck with everything, and I’ll see you tomorrow! Have a great day!
