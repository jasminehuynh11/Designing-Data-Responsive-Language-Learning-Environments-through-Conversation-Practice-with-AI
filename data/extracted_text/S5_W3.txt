Week 3 – Task 1
나의 말:
I am contacting Internet company to report that the Internet is not working. I will describe the problem, ask for assistance, and check when the issue will be fixed. Practise speaking clearly and politely in a service setting. You are Internet support staff
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course. Thanks for calling today. Can you please tell me what seems to be happening with your internet connection?
나의 말:
“Hi”
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Hi there! Absolutely.
나의 말:
“Hi, this is Kim.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Alright, Kim! Nice to meet you. So let's figure this out—could you let me know exactly what issue you're noticing
나의 말:
“My internet has stopped working, so I just call you.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Got it, absolutely. Thanks for letting me know. Let's start by checking if you've noticed any lights on your router or if there's any error message showing up on your end?
나의 말:
“Sorry, what is the louder?”
00:02
English Conversational Partner의 말:
No worries at all! So the router is basically the little box that gives you the Wi-Fi signal. Do you see any lights on it right now?
나의 말:
“Yes, I can see the lights on the router.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Perfect, that's helpful. Now, are any of those lights blinking in a different color or do they all look normal?
나의 말:
“I guess it's just blinking.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Alright, that makes sense. Thanks for letting me know. So based on that, let's see if we can figure out when we can get this resolved for you. Could you let me know how long it's been down so far?
나의 말:
“Two days ago, it's working, but from yesterday, it's been not working, so I tried to set up again and turn off the loader and turn on again, rebooting, but it doesn't work, so I just ask you to help me.”
00:29
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I get it. Thanks for trying all that. So let's go ahead and see what kind of fix we can line up for you. Could you just tell me your account number or the address on the account so I can check the details?
나의 말:
“Okay, my address is 90 Menzies Road, Mossfield, Sydney.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure, that helps a
나의 말:
“Use those wheels.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Got it, thanks for that info. So I'll check the system for any known issues in your area and see when we can get this resolved for you. In the meantime, have you noticed if any of your neighbors are having the same problem, or is it just you?
나의 말:
“I have no idea because I didn't check it yet. But if I should do, I would just ask my neighbors right now.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, that's perfectly fine. So no rush on that. I'll go ahead and see what we can find out from our side, and then we'll figure out the next steps. Does that sound good to you?
나의 말:
“Yeah, thank you. Yeah, that's perfect.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure thing! Happy to help. So I'll dig into it and we'll be in touch as soon as I have an update for you. If anything else comes up, just let me know!
나의 말:
“Yes, but I'm just curious if a technician should visit my place. When is he or she available?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I hear you. So it looks like if we do need to send a technician out, the earliest available slot would likely be within the next day or two. We'll confirm that as soon as we check the details. Anything else you'd like to know in the meantime?
나의 말:
“Sorry, pardon. This area has a party tonight, so I can't hear you. Could you please say that again?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course, no problem at all! I was just saying that if we do need to send someone out, we can probably have a technician available in the next day or two. So once I confirm the details, I'll let you know. Anything else I can help with?
나의 말:
“Yeah, can you just check it right now? Because the internet don't connect. It makes me very stressed.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I totally understand that it's stressful. I'll check it out right now on our end and see what we can do to speed things up. Just hang tight for a moment and I'll get you some info.
나의 말:
“What time is available?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! So it looks like we can likely arrange a technician as early as tomorrow afternoon. We'll confirm the exact time shortly. Does that work for you?
나의 말:
“Liz, sounds good.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Great! We'll set that up and make sure someone can come by tomorrow afternoon. If anything changes, just let us know. We'll keep you posted.
나의 말:
“Okay, then someone will call me, or I should just wait here.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, someone will give you a quick call to confirm that time with you, so just hang tight and we'll be in touch. Let us know if you need anything else.
나의 말:
“That's great. Thank you.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure thing! Happy to
나의 말:
“And sometimes the internet connection is still working and it's good, but you know, sometimes it's very slow, then what should I do?”
00:16
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I get that. So if it slows down again, just let us know and we can run some tests or give you some tips. We'll definitely help you out.
나의 말:
“Is there any remote system like website? I should visit website and sign up for the program or service?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure thing! So if you want, you can actually just visit our official support website to check your connection status or any service updates. But no sign-ups are needed for extra services right now—just a handy place to look if you want to. Anything else on your mind?
나의 말:
“Because after working, I usually got home around 10 p.m. And you know, customer service, we cannot use at that time. So I'm just wondering if I can use this customer service on the app or anything else.”
00:21
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I get that. So the good news is you can definitely use our app or the online support anytime, even late at night. So just hop on there whenever you need to, and you'll have access.
나의 말:
“Sorry.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner의 말:
No worries at all! Basically, you can just hop on the app or the website whenever it suits you, even if it's late. So you've got that option anytime.
나의 말:
“Okay, I see.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure thing! Glad I
나의 말:
“I have one more thing, for me, I live in room 305, and next to my room, there is a girl, and she said sometimes it's not working, then she doesn't know what to do, then can you give me some advice to fix the problems?”
00:28
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely! So one simple tip: if she runs into issues, she can just try restarting her router first, just like you did. And if that doesn't help, she can use the same support line or the app to get help. It's pretty straightforward, and that should do the trick for her.
나의 말:
“Okay, thank you for updating. Thank you for letting me know. It's very helpful.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, you're very welcome! I'm glad it was helpful. And of course, if you need anything else, just let me know anytime.
나의 말:
“Yeah, you said the technician will visit tomorrow evening, but I don't know the exact time because I have plans tomorrow night, so can you please let me know the exact time?”
00:19
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I can do that. So as soon as we confirm the exact time, I'll make sure to let you know so you can plan around it. We'll keep you updated as soon as we have that info.
나의 말:
“Oh, I see. Then I need to call... I need to be called by you. And if I miss the call, what happens? Did you... Will you text me or should I check it on the app?”
00:17
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! So if you happen to miss the call, no worries at all. We'll either send you a quick text or update you through the app so you can check there easily. That way you'll still get all the info.
나의 말:
“That's really good. Thank you.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, happy to

English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure thing! Glad to
나의 말:
“I just, yeah, what I need to do is just wait the technician's call and reschedule, set the schedule for the exact time and the technician will visit my place and fix the problem. Is that right?”
00:20
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, you've got it just right. So just wait for that confirmation and then the technician will come by and sort it out for you. That's exactly it!
나의 말:
“I see. Thank you. Then, can you give me a reference number for this request?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, sure thing! So your reference number for this request is actually 83752. Just keep that handy, and if you need to follow up, you can use that number.
나의 말:
“Okay, then I need to... I need some paper and pen. Can you please say that again? Sorry.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course, no problem at all. The reference number is 83752. Just jot that down whenever you're ready, and you're all set.
나의 말:
“837004, is that right?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Exactly, you got it. It's 83752. So just keep that handy, and you're good to go.

“Take care.”

You too! Take care and have a great one.























Task 2
I have lost something important and need to report it either to a lost-and-found service for a minor report. Practise speaking clearly and politely in a formal setting. Your role as a lost-and-found assistant or police officer.
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course. I can help with that. Could you please tell me what exactly you’ve lost?
나의 말:
“I've just realized I lost my phone.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. Thanks for letting me know. Now, could you let me know where you last remember having it?
나의 말:
“I have no idea, but I am at the train station, and I took the train from the Mercury University to Central, and I think I just left them at my seat.”
00:20
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Got it. That helps a lot. So just to confirm, you think you might have left your phone on the train seat somewhere between the university and Central Station. Could you also let me know the approximate time you were traveling?
나의 말:
“Yeah, uh, it was today and around 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. I have no idea what to do, so I'm just ask someone to use their phone to call you. So I'm sorry, but I have only 10 minutes.”
00:21
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure, that’s totally understandable. Thanks for sharing the time frame with me. Let’s do this: I’ll note down that it was around 5 to 6 p.m. and we’ll check if any trains arriving at Central have turned in a phone. Now, just one more quick thing: could you describe what your phone looks like or any identifying details about it?
나의 말:
“제 휴대폰은 아이폰 15입니다. 핑크색이지만, 아기 핑크와 흰색의 핑크입니다. 실제 핑크가 아니라 흰색의 핑크입니다. 또한, 두개의 카메라가 있습니다. 제 휴대폰에는 케이스와 케이스와 케이스가 있습니다.”
00:35
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Alright, that’s helpful
나의 말:
“Yeah, I have a case, but it has no color, so it's like a mirror, so I can see my phone's color.”
00:14
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Alright, perfect. So you've got a kind of white-pink iPhone 15 in a mirrored case. That should make it stand out a bit. Now, let me just ask: is there anything else unique about it, like a lock screen image or any stickers, or is it pretty simple otherwise?
나의 말:
“I set the background just on a very basic one, so it's maybe pink and black and white color,”
00:15
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Alright, that’s all
나의 말:
텍스트 기록 사용할 수 없음
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure, that’s all I need. I’ll note that down—just a simple pink, black, and white background on the phone. We’ll do our best to see if it’s been handed in. And just to wrap up, is there any particular number or email we should contact you at once we find it?
나의 말:
“Oh, yeah, I would just want you to know my email. My email address is quf40a3naver.com.”
00:18
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Alright, got it. I’ll note down that email so we can contact you as soon as it turns up. We’ll do our best to help you out. Thanks for giving me all the details!
나의 말:
“Yeah, I'm just want to check, so could you please say my email address again so that I can check?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure, absolutely. So the email I’ve got down here is quf4083 at naver.com. Let me know if that sounds right to you.
나의 말:
“Yeah, that's perfect. Beautiful.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Great, glad that matches up perfectly. We’ll reach out to you there if we find your phone. If you need anything else, just let me know!
나의 말:
“Okay, thank you. Then, do I need to show ID when it's collected?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! Yeah, you'll just need to bring a bit of ID when you come to pick it up, just so we can confirm it’s really yours. Other than that, you're all set!
나의 말:
“Okay then, but I guess in my iPhone on my phone there is a small wallet on the phone and I think my ID is in it, then how can I do that?”
00:16
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I understand. If your ID is with the phone itself, that’s no problem at all. We’ll just verify things when you arrive by maybe confirming some other detail with you, and we’ll figure it out together. No worries at all.
나의 말:
“You can ask my birth of date or you can ask my name or address, things like that.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Exactly, you’ve got it. We can just confirm something like your name or your date of birth when you come in, and that’ll be enough. So we’ll sort it out once we’ve got your phone here.
나의 말:
“Okay, then I'm just curious, I usually have work, so I'm not sure if I have time to find it or not. So if my friends or my family can go there instead of me, and does it work for you?”
00:19
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, that can work just fine. If a friend or family member comes in on your behalf, just let us know in advance who they are, and we can have them confirm a detail or two that you give them. That way, they can pick it up for you and it’ll all be nice and easy.
나의 말:
“Okay, then do they need to take an ID as well?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! Yeah, it's a good idea for them to bring their own ID just so we know who’s picking it up. That way everything’s covered and it’ll be nice and smooth.
나의 말:
“Oh, that's a really good idea. Then, if there's no phone, you guys try to find if someone can steal my phone. So I don't, I might not find it, then what should I do?”
00:21
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I get that concern. So if it turns out we can’t find the phone and it’s possibly lost or stolen, the best next step is to report it as missing to your mobile provider. They can help lock it down or track it. And of course, we’ll keep your details on file in case it turns up later.
나의 말:
“I see. Then, what time should I wait? Like, it's 7pm right now. So, usually you guys will find it today or tomorrow.”
00:16
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! So typically, we'll do our best to check in with the trains and the station staff today, but realistically, it might be tomorrow before we know for sure. So I’d say just give it until tomorrow and then feel free to check back in if you haven’t heard anything.
나의 말:
“Okay, then you mean you guys will Try to find my phone until tomorrow and after tomorrow if there's no phone. I can just call the phone provider or the police then I can Yeah, they can help me. Is that right?”
00:21
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Exactly, you’ve got it. We’ll do our best to track it down until tomorrow, and if it doesn’t turn up by then, you can definitely go ahead and reach out to your phone provider or the police to get some extra help. We'll do everything we can on our side in the meantime.
나의 말:
“I see, okay, thank you. Then how long do you keep lost items on file?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! So generally, we keep lost items for around 30 days. That gives people plenty of time to come and claim them. So if we do find it, you've got about a month to pick it up.
나의 말:
“This sounds perfect. Thank you.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, happy to help! And if you need anything else, just let me know.
나의 말:
“Okay, then, by any chance, if there's no phone, do you have a CCTV?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! We do have some CCTV coverage in certain areas, like the station platforms. If needed, we can coordinate with the station staff to check if there’s any helpful footage. So if it comes to that, we can definitely look into it.
나의 말:
“And can I check it together?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! We can definitely help you with that if it becomes necessary. Usually, the station staff will review the footage first, and then we can let you know what we find. So if we need to check it, we’ll handle it together and keep you in the loop.
나의 말:
“I see. So you mean the staff needs to check first and if there is any problem, then they will let me know and I can check together, right?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Exactly, you’ve got it. The staff will take a look first, and if there's anything relevant, they'll let you know and we can go from there. So we'll keep you informed every step of the way.
나의 말:
“I got you. Thank you for helping me.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course, happy to help. And if you need anything else at all, just let me know.
나의 말:
“I guess that's all. Thanks for explaining everything. I really appreciate your help.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, you’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help clarify everything for you. If you need anything else, just reach out. Otherwise, take care and good luck!
나의 말:
“Take care. Thank you very much. I'll check back tomorrow.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure thing! You're very welcome, and feel free to check back in tomorrow. Have a good one!
나의 말:
“Bye-bye.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Bye! Take care and we'll talk to you soon.
