WEEK 4 – TASK 1: 

What study program or goal are you currently considering?
Tú dijiste:
I graduated 5 years ago with a Master in Business Administration, but now I think so I need to give a new step about my professional development. I would like to make a Master Research, but I don't know what is the best option.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Alright, thanks for explaining your situation.
So, you finished an MBA 5 years ago and now you’re interested in a research-oriented master’s degree to advance your professional development.
To guide you properly, I need to understand your goal:
Are you mainly interested in a research master to prepare for a future PhD, or to strengthen your career profile in industry (for example, consulting, data analysis, academia-related roles)?
Tú dijiste:
That is the point. Now, I don't know about what is the best option for me Maybe I'd like to do data analysis for a new business and sustainable
English Conversational Partner dijo:
I see—so you’re unsure whether to focus more on research or industry, but you feel attracted to data analysis and sustainability for new businesses.
To help you choose a suitable path, can you tell me what kind of work you’re doing now and which parts of your current job you enjoy the most?
Tú dijiste:
Currently, I have a professional break, but I used to be an accountant in big companies or big firms. Now, in the last past, I have experienced selling business to business. I would like to be sustainable more for business to business in organic things, but I have a real background about business and finances.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Alright, thanks for clarifying — you’ve worked in accounting and B2B sales, and now you’re interested in data, sustainability, and possibly organic-product business models. That’s a solid foundation.
To guide you toward the right type of master’s program, I need to understand your direction a bit better.
What kind of role do you imagine yourself doing after this new qualification — more analytical (like data analyst or sustainability analyst), more strategic (like sustainable business development), or more entrepreneurial?
Tú dijiste:
I think so maybe a strategic like sustainable business development and entrepreneur 
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure, that makes sense — a strategic, sustainability-focused path fits well with your background.
To recommend the right type of research master’s, I need to know your study preferences.
Would you prefer a program that is more research-intensive (writing a thesis, working with a supervisor) or one that is more applied, with practical projects for sustainable business development?
Tú dijiste:
The second one I think is the best option, practical project for sustainable business development.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Pensó durante 4 segundos
Alright, a practical, project-based program in sustainable business development sounds like a strong match for you. We could look at programs like Sustainable Business / Sustainability Management / Sustainable Entrepreneurship with real-company projects.
Which country or region are you thinking about studying in (or are you open to online / international options)?
Tú dijiste:
I'm open to move whenever we have a good master for research, but I prefer Europe, Australia, Canada, and i didn't want to countries in Africa or Middle East.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Pensó durante 9s
Alright, that gives us a clear region to focus on—Europe, Australia, or Canada, with a practical master’s in sustainable business and entrepreneurship.
To narrow suitable programs for you, when would you ideally like to start this new master’s—within the next year, or are you thinking more long-term (in 2–3 years)?
Tú dijiste:
Two or three years is okay for me, longer I don't think so.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Alright, a 2–3 year horizon is very reasonable, it gives you time to prepare your profile and applications.
To choose suitable programs, would you prefer to study full-time (focus mainly on the master) or part-time while you continue working or running a business?
Tú dijiste:
For me, the best is to apply for a scholarship because I want to focus on my study full-time, but it's not possible, I need part-time because I need to work.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure, thanks for explaining that — part-time study alongside work is a practical choice.
To find programs that fit your schedule, do you prefer something mostly online or a hybrid format where you occasionally attend classes on campus?
Tú dijiste:
The best option is hybrid because it's more comfortable for me and can save money to transportation and maybe I can prepare my food in my house.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure, hybrid makes a lot of sense, especially for saving time and money while you study.
Since many programs in Europe, Canada and Australia are in English, what languages are you comfortable studying in—only English, or also another language like French, Spanish, or German?
Tú dijiste:
I am a Spanish speaker, but currently I am improving my English. I think the program can be in English and Spanish.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Alright, good to know — English or Spanish programs both work for you.
To point you toward realistic hybrid, part-time options, what budget range or tuition level are you comfortable with for the whole program?
Tú dijiste:
Can you give me a possible budget? Because I don't have an idea about that. Now it's just an idea.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure. For hybrid, part-time master’s programs in sustainable business or entrepreneurship, here are typical ranges:
Europe
• Spain / Portugal / Eastern Europe: €5,000–€12,000 total
• Germany / Netherlands / Nordics: €10,000–€22,000 total
• UK / Ireland: £12,000–£25,000 total
Canada
• Public universities: CAD 12,000–25,000 per year
• Total for a 2-year program: CAD 24,000–50,000
Australia
• Most programs: AUD 20,000–35,000 per year
• Total for 1.5–2 years: AUD 30,000–60,000
Alright, those are common ranges.
To match the right programs for you, how long would you prefer the master’s to be—about 1 year, 1.5 years, or closer to 2 years?
Tú dijiste:
Okay, I think so is my average for budget and we can check all the universities, maybe five programs, and then you tell me what, in your opinion, what is the best option for me. And then I need to check more information about each country because the plan of the country is more expensive, the things, like food, rent, something like that.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Pensó durante 10s
Sure, that’s a good plan—first we create a short list of about five suitable programs, then you compare tuition and cost of living in each country.
Before I suggest specific types of programs (for example, in Spain, Germany, Canada, or Australia), do you prefer a shorter intensive master (about 1 year) or a longer program (closer to 2 years)?
Tú dijiste:
Perfect. I think it's really good information. It's possible you send me an email when you have my options. I really appreciate your time.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Of course — and thank you for your kind words.
I can’t send emails, but you can save or copy this conversation anytime.
If you need more help later, just let me know.
Have a great day, and good luck with your plans!
Tú dijiste:
All of your information was amazing, I really appreciate that. And if you think so, you can send me an email and as soon as possible I will say my answer. Thank you, have a good one.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure, and thank you again for your kindness.
I’m not able to send emails, but I’m always here whenever you want to continue.
Take care, and have a great day!


TASK 2: 
Hello, we have just started our group project, can we plan the tasks together?
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure, happy to plan together. What exactly is the project about so we know what tasks we need to divide?
Tú dijiste:
We need to write a new project about sustainability, but I think so we need to divide the project in different steps.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Alright, dividing it into steps makes sense. Which main sections or stages do you think we should include for this sustainability project?
Tú dijiste:
I think some of the projects have five steps, but it's very important who is looking for information, who is writing the report, and who is checking the information, and who is presenting.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure, those roles are important. So if we have five steps, we can match each step with a clear responsibility. Which role would you personally prefer to take—research, writing, checking, or presenting?
Tú dijiste:
I prefer to look at information and research. It's easier for me. I feel really comfortable to do that.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Alright, great — if research feels comfortable for you, that works well for the team. To plan smoothly, how much information do you think you can gather, and by when can you finish the first part of the research?
Tú dijiste:
I have a question. Who wants to do the writing part?
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure, I can take the writing part if that works for everyone. When would you like me to have the first draft ready?
Tú dijiste:
Do you have any template can you share with me but the process will be easy for you?
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Sure, I can share a simple writing template we can follow:
Introduction – aim of the project
Background – key sustainability issues
Findings – your research results
Discussion – what the results mean
Conclusion & recommendations
Would you like me to start filling this template once you finish your research notes?
Tú dijiste:
Oh wow, so quick. Thank you for the information. Maybe I send the information in two weeks business day. Thank you so much. See you soon.
English Conversational Partner dijo:
Alright, no problem. I’ll wait for your notes in two weeks. See you soon!
