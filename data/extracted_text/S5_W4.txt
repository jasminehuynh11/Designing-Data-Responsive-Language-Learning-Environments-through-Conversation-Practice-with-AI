Task1

나의 말:
I am speaking with an academic advisor to get guidance about my current study plans or future career options. I want to explain my situation, ask for advice, and clarify next steps. Practise speaking clearly and professionally in a formal setting. The chatbot’s role is a university advisor or career counsellor.
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure. What would you like to focus on today—your current programme, future career direction, or something else about your studies?
나의 말:
“My name is Eunbyul Kim. My English name is Amber, and I'm from Korea. I just got here three days ago, and now I took an A1 class, which means Academic 1 level. And I think it's too academic because for me, I have a job in Korea, and after in, I mean, in one year, I have to go back to my country. So I don't think I need Academic 1. So could you please give me some advice?”
00:50
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, Amber. So it sounds like you're wondering if that academic level is actually the right fit given your limited time here. Let's start by figuring out what your main goal is for this year. Are you mainly looking to just pick up a certain skill, or are you aiming for something else during your time here?
나의 말:
“Actually, I haven't have any specific goal, but I just want to improve my English, especially everyday English. So, that's why I don't think I need to study Academic 1. So, last three days, I took an academic class, and I feel like it's too difficult, and sometimes I don't need it in real life days. So, that's why I'm just, I don't know, I'm not sure it's the right fit.”
00:41
English Conversational Partner의 말:
All right, I understand. So if your main aim is really just to improve everyday English and not focus on academic language, then we can definitely look into some more practical or conversational English options for you. My next question would be: would you prefer a class that's more conversation-based or maybe a more general English skills course that's less formal?
나의 말:
“Actually, I have no idea because for, I mean, I think to improve my English skills, the most important thing is to get an opportunity to speak out as much as I can. Also, I feel like I want to get a lesson about basic and less formal English. Can I do both?”
00:32
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. We can definitely do both. So it sounds like you’d benefit from something that’s more of a general conversational English class that really emphasizes just speaking practice and everyday communication rather than anything too formal or academic. So let me ask: would you prefer a class that's more in a small group setting or maybe even one-on-one sessions?
나의 말:
“What do you mean one-on-one session?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! I just mean like a private lesson, just you and the teacher, so you get all the speaking time and personal attention. Or if you'd rather practice with a few other students, we can do that too. Which one do you think you'd be more comfortable with?
나의 말:
“I'm not sure, but for me, one-on-one lesson is more efficient, I think, because if I went wrong with something, then the teacher can correct me. But, you know, with friends, we can do more conversation about everything. So, I think it's, yeah, oh, I have no idea. Can you recommend some?”
00:32
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely! So it sounds like a one-on-one lesson would give you that direct correction and personal feedback you’re looking for, which is definitely more efficient if you want to build confidence quickly. But we can also make sure you have some casual group practice now and then if you want to chat with others. In other words, we can mix and match a bit. So let’s plan on starting you with some individual sessions, and then we can add a group session if you feel like you want to. How does that sound to you?
나의 말:
“Yeah, it sounds perfect, and I was wondering if I, um, if I do that with multicultural students, like, um, from different culture, like, from different cultures?”
00:18
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely! So we can definitely arrange that. We'll set you up so you can join some sessions with students from all sorts of different cultural backgrounds, which is great because you’ll get a variety of accents and ways of speaking, and that can really help you get comfortable with everyday English in all kinds of situations. So let’s plan on that, and we’ll get you started.
나의 말:
“Yeah, but, um, I'm worried about one thing, which is if we have a variety of accents that I can learn from each other, so my English accent or words can be worse, so I'm worried about that. How can I deal with that?”
00:22
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure, I get that concern. So what we can do is make sure that your one-on-one instructor is giving you a clear standard model to follow. That way, even if you're hearing a lot of different accents from your classmates, you'll still have that consistent guidance on how to speak in a way that's clear and neutral. So don't worry—you won't lose your way. We'll just add variety as a bonus, but you'll always have a strong baseline to rely on.
나의 말:
“Okay, thank you. But I worry about one thing. And actually, to get to Berkeley University College, I already took some tests, like placement tests, three times. And for two times, I got a result about BE class, which is direct entry before going to the university. So it's kind of high level, higher level class. But for me, I have enough time to study English and Macquarie University assigned me to A1 class. And so I heard after A1 class that I will move on to A2, A3, like that. So after all, I will get to the maximum level. But I'm worried about that if I do, if I do, or if I take general English level, that it can be much easier than academic one. So I'm worried about that, if it's okay to improve my English. Because, you know, we can learn from each other, like our colleagues, our friends, but they don't speak English very much, as much as I can. So, yeah, that's my concern.”
01:47
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I get where you're coming from. So here's the thing: moving to a more general English class will definitely be a bit easier than the academic class, but that's okay because it aligns better with your goal of focusing on everyday English. And don't worry about it being too easy—you’ll still be improving and you'll get that important speaking practice. Plus, we can always adjust the level as you go. So you'll be in good hands and you’ll keep improving your English just fine.
나의 말:
“Good, what does that mean in good hands? I'm sorry.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! It just means you'll be well taken care of and supported. In other words, we'll make sure you're in a good situation to keep improving your English. So no need to apologize—that’s all it means!
나의 말:
“Okay, thank you. And if I finish that course, then how long will it take? Will it be finished?”
00:10
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course! So typically a general English course like that might run for, let’s say, a few months depending on how intensive it is. We can give you a clearer timeline once we see your schedule and how many classes per week you want. But in general, you'll probably finish up in a few months and we’ll guide you through the whole process.
나의 말:
“Okay, then if I finish that course, then usually do people go to the university like diploma or master's degree?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! So usually once people finish a general English course and they feel confident, they do sometimes move on to a diploma or a master's program if that’s their goal. So it's definitely a common next step if you want to continue your studies at university level. But of course, it's all up to you and what you feel comfortable with.
나의 말:
“Yeah, what's the big difference? How is the diploma different from the master's degree?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! So basically a diploma is usually a shorter, more focused program. It can be more practical and take maybe a year or so. A master's degree is longer and more advanced, often taking a couple of years and going deeper into a field. So that's the main difference, and you can choose what fits your goals best.
나의 말:
“If I already graduate from the university in Korea, can I take, can I do a diploma as well in Australia?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, you can. So even if you've already graduated from university in Korea, it's totally possible to do a diploma in Australia. It's actually pretty common for people who want to get some additional qualifications or a more practical focus. So yeah, you can definitely do that.
나의 말:
“If I want to study a diploma or master's degree, what should I do? How can I prepare?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. So the first step would be to look at the entry requirements for the diploma or master's program you're interested in. Usually, that means making sure your English level is where it needs to be, which you're already working on. Then you might need to gather your academic transcripts, maybe a personal statement, and possibly some references. Once you have those things ready, you can apply to the program that fits you. And of course, we can help guide you through that process whenever you're ready.
나의 말:
“Okay, and my major in university was education, especially for elementary school students. So, yes, it's kind of elementary education, but if I want to do a master's degree, then how can it work?”
00:29
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. So if your background is in elementary education and you want to do a master's in that area, that's definitely possible. Basically, you'd look for a master's program in education that has a focus on elementary or primary education. And really the main thing is just meeting their entry requirements, which usually means having that relevant background—which you do—and the right level of English. So once you find a program that fits, you can apply and take it from there.
나의 말:
“Oh, okay. Thanks for your time. I'll look into those options.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner의 말:
You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions down the line, just let me know. Otherwise, good luck exploring those options and take care!
나의 말:
“All good. Take care. Bye.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Bye! Take care and best of luck with everything!


















TASK3

나의 말:
I’m participating in a feedback session with a teacher, manager, or supervisor. i need to listen actively, ask questions, respond respectfully, and reflect on ways to improve. Practise using constructive, calm, and polite language. The chatbot’s role is a supervisor, teacher, or manager.
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Alright. Thanks for coming in today. To start, what part of your recent work or performance would you most like to get feedback on?
나의 말:
“Hi, I've just finished my class presentation, which is about Korean culture. Could you talk about it?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely! So, let’s dive in. What’s one area of your presentation on Korean culture that you’re particularly curious about improving or hearing my thoughts on?
나의 말:
“저는 학생들에게 작은 그룹 프레젠테이션을 했습니다. 학생들은 한국 문화와 K-POP, 한국 전통을 배웠습니다.” (I did a small group presentation to the students. The students learned about Korean culture and K-pop and traditional things)
00:21
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! I hear you.
나의 말:
“things, clothes, and the special days.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, got it. So, let’s focus on that. How did you feel the students responded to the parts about traditional clothing or those special cultural days?
나의 말:
“I think they looked very interested in our cultures because these days Korean culture like movies or music are very popular so I think children's students looks very interested in it and interested in them and about for about Korean clothes they look they they they also interested in it because the Korean style clothes hanbok is very huge but oh some people asked me the difference between the kimono and hanbok and I just answered it's uh Korean is hanbok is Korean style and kimono is Japanese style so I just wanted to be more specific answer but I don't know I didn't know I had no idea”
01:18
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! That makes sense. It sounds like they were really engaged, and it’s great they were curious about those differences. So let's do this: what kind of additional detail would you like to have on hand if they ask again?
나의 말:
텍스트 기록 사용할 수 없음
00:00
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course! So, if you’d like a bit more detail, we can definitely help with that. For example, we can look at a reliable source about the unique features of hanbok versus kimono. So let me know if you’d like me to find a specific source for that, or if you have any other question about how to handle those student questions.
나의 말:
“give me some specific advice.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. For a bit of concrete advice, let’s rely on some solid info. For instance, a well-documented fact is that hanbok is known for its vibrant colors and flowing lines, while kimono typically features more intricate layering and different types of sashes. We can definitely find a reliable cultural reference that confirms that if you'd like. But let me ask you: would you like me to look up a specific source on that difference for you?
나의 말:
“Yes, please.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Alright, sure! So just to keep it factual, here’s a reliable detail: a trusted cultural source like a museum or a well-cited cultural website will confirm that hanbok is characterized by its simple lines and bright colors, while kimono has more structured layers and often silk patterns. If you’d like, I can find you a specific reference to cite exactly that. Just let me know!
나의 말:
“Yeah, I think it's fine. I'll look it up later. Thank you.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, happy to help. If you need anything else, just let me know. In the meantime, how else can I support you with your presentation skills?
나의 말:
텍스트 기록 사용할 수 없음
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course! So,
나의 말:
“I tried to remember what I wanted to say, but sometimes it's very challenging, so how can I do that? How can I deal with that?”
00:15
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! One good tip from trusted public speaking sources is to rely on a few key bullet points rather than memorizing every word. That way, you stay flexible and it’s easier to remember your main ideas. So just let me know if you have any other questions about that!
나의 말:
“Do you mean I should write down some simple words?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Exactly, that's right! Just a couple of simple keywords or bullet points can really help you stay on track. Now, is there any other area you’d like to go over to make your presentation even smoother?
나의 말:
“I have one more question. If I want to write down something about my presentation, what's the most efficient way to track that point? I mean, if I do the presentation, then there will be a screenshot which is not included in bullet point or keywords. Then I need to track that word, but I don't know how to do that. I mean, I just write down on the small notepad or something like that. What would you recommend?”
00:52
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. So a reliable approach a lot of people recommend is to use a small notepad or even cue cards with just those key words. That way you can glance down quickly and still keep your focus on your audience. So if you want to do that, it’s definitely a proven method. And is there anything else you'd like to ask about that?
나의 말:
“Also, sometimes I was wondering if it's okay to use the presenter. It's like, when I press the button, then the screen will move on to the next one. So, it's really helpful because I don't need to care about the keyboard. If I use that presenter, it's very helpful. So, is it a good way to have a good presentation?”
00:38
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely! Using a presenter remote is actually a well-recommended and efficient technique. It's definitely something you'll find lots of experienced speakers do, and it's a reliable way to keep your hands free and not worry about the keyboard. So you're definitely on the right track there. And is there anything else you’re curious about?
나의 말:
“For me, if I'm very nervous, then my attitude is not that good. So sometimes it really feels awkward with my hand gesture. What should I do?”
00:19
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! A really reliable tip from public speaking experts is to practice just a couple of simple, natural gestures so you feel more at ease. So if you want to do that, it can definitely help you feel less awkward. And if you need any more advice, just let me know!
나의 말:
“What kind of hand gestures are reliable during the presentation?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely! So, one reliable piece of advice is to keep your gestures simple and open—like using your hands to lightly emphasize a point or just keeping them at a comfortable level. And if you need any more tips, feel free to ask!
나의 말:
“I'm sorry. I've got lost. You're worried? Hand free something? The last sentence, what did you say?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course! Just to repeat that tip clearly: a reliable approach is to keep your gestures simple and open, like using your hands naturally to emphasize a point. And if there's anything else you're curious about, just let me know!
나의 말:
“And sometimes, you know, some students or some audience looks very bored because the content is not that funny or sometimes very boring. Then what should I do to get their attention?”
00:17
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. One really reliable way to keep their attention, based on good presentation practices, is to add a small, engaging story or a real-life example that you know is verified and true. That can really help bring the topic to life. So if you want to do that, it might help them stay engaged. And if you have any other questions, just let me know!
나의 말:
“Could you please explain it again in a more simpler way?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course! In simple terms, just share a quick real example or a little story that’s definitely true. That often makes the topic more interesting for them. And if you need any more help, just let me know!
나의 말:
“Yeah, but I'm just wondering, you know, everyone has different interests, and everyone has different area which they like. Then how can I work on that?”
00:17
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely! So the simple answer is: a reliable approach is to include one or two small examples that relate to different interests. That way, you touch on something that might connect with everyone. And if you need any more advice, just let me know!
나의 말:
“Yeah, and the last thing is, is it an effective way to have a reward, like if someone got the answers, if someone get the answer, then I can give them a present like candies or ballpoint pens like that. Is it an effective way or it's just an instant way to pay their attention?”
00:30
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. A reliable and well-supported tip is that small rewards like a piece of candy or a little token can definitely help keep people engaged. It's a proven technique to make it a bit more fun and interactive. So yes, it's actually an effective way and not just an instant trick. And if you have any other questions, just let me know!
나의 말:
“So, would you recommend the small reward like”
00:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I'd say yes.
나의 말:
“Some more GPT. Some more GPT.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Sure! In fact, it's definitely a well-supported idea to use small rewards like that. It's a reliable and commonly recommended way to keep people engaged. So if you want to do that, go for it! And if you have any more questions, just let me know.
나의 말:
“With my hand gesture, what should I do? What kind of hand gestures are reliable during the presentation? I'm sorry, I've got lost. You're right. Hand free something? The last sentence, what did you say? Okay, thank you. And sometimes you know some students or some audience looks very bored because the content is not that funny or sometimes very boring. Then what should I do to get their attention? Could you please explain it again more simply? But I'm just wondering, you know, everyone has different interests and everyone has different areas which they like. Then how can I work on that? Yeah, and the last thing is, is it an effective way to have a reward? Like if someone got the answers, if someone got the answer, then I can give them a present like candies or ballpoint pens like that. Is it effective way or it's just instant way to pay their attention? Would you recommend the small reward like a small gift? Yeah, I think it's important to keep people's attention during the presentation. Otherwise, both like the audience and I will get in trouble.”
04:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely, I agree. It's definitely important to keep everyone engaged so that the whole presentation runs smoothly. And those little techniques, like small rewards, can be a reliable way to do it. So if you have any other questions, just let me know!
나의 말:
“Yeah, what would you recommend I focus on improving next?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Absolutely. So I’d say one good, reliable focus is just to keep practicing those small engagement techniques we talked about—like using a little story or a small reward. That’s a well-backed way to keep improving. And if you have anything else you want to tackle, just let me know!
나의 말:
“I think, yeah, that's it. Thanks again. Thank you. Thanks again. This gave me a lot to think about.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner의 말:
Of course! Glad I could help. If you ever need anything else, just let me know. Take care and good luck with your presentations!
나의 말:
“Thank you, take care.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner의 말:
You're very welcome! Take care and have a great day.
