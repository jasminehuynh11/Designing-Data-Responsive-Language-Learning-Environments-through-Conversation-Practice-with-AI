TASK 1: 
Hello, you're an academic advisor or career counselor, and I'm asking you to get guidance about my current study plans or future career options. Could we start the communication?”
00:19
English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely! I'd be happy to help you with your academic and career planning. To get started, could you tell me what field or area of study you're currently considering?
You said：
“I'm studying social media, but I'm not sure it's the right fit, and I want to do something more, maybe.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said：
Got it! Social media is definitely an exciting field. What aspects of social media are you most interested in, like content creation, analytics, marketing, or something else?
You said：
“communication on social media.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said：
That’s a great focus! Social media communication is really impactful. Are you thinking about working in a specific industry, like fashion, tech, or maybe non-profits?
You said：
“Yeah, I want to know when I'm graduated, what should I do in the market, or what role should I be?”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said：
That's a great question! There are definitely a variety of roles you can consider, like social media manager, content strategist, or community manager. Do you have any particular strengths or skills that you'd like to leverage in your future role?
You said：
“I like photography and I took a lot of wonderful videos for a lot of scenes.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said：
Oh, that's fantastic! Your photography and videography skills will definitely be a big asset in social media. Would you say you're more interested in creating visual content, or do you also enjoy the strategic side of planning that content?
You said：
“Yes, of course, and I like the social media very much, but I don't know what will I do in the future, or what kind of work experience will I looking for, so I can prepare for it more wonderful.”
00:23
English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. It's great to have a clear vision. There are roles like social media content creator, brand strategist, or even a digital marketing specialist. Do you have a particular industry that you think you'd like to focus on, or are you still exploring that?
You said：
“Just because I'm looking forward to do something interesting and I love to, but maybe I can't find the most adapt to me about the role. And I'm studying overseas right now. In the future, will I go back to China or stay at Sydney? What do you think about it?”
00:30
English Conversational Partner said：
That's a really exciting consideration! Both options have their own unique advantages. Sydney is a fantastic hub for social media and marketing, and China has a huge market as well. It really depends on where you see the best opportunities and where you'd feel more at home. What kind of environment do you think you'd thrive in the most?
You said：
“Both of the environments are alike, but maybe in Sydney it is more comfortable, but in China maybe I will have a lot of chances, more than Sydney, I think.”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said：
That makes a lot of sense! Sydney definitely offers a comfortable lifestyle, and China can be a great place for career growth. It sounds like you have a solid foundation to make a great choice. If you need any more guidance on specific roles or steps, just let me know!
You said：
“So what do you think about the two markets, international markets?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said：
I think that's a fantastic idea! International marketing can really open up a lot of opportunities, especially with your skill set in social media and content creation. It could give you a unique edge in the field!
You said：
“So what's your advice?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said：
I would say definitely leverage your strengths in content creation and your understanding of different markets. Being open to working internationally is a great advantage, and you can definitely find a niche that suits you. Keep building those skills, and you’ll be in a fantastic spot!
You said：
“I want more specific options about the two markets, just in Sydney or back to China.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said：
Got it! If you stay in Sydney, you might find opportunities with global companies that have a presence there, giving you that international exposure. On the other hand, going back to China could put you right in the heart of a rapidly evolving market with tons of opportunities in tech and e-commerce. So, it really depends on whether you want that global experience from Sydney or a more immersive experience back home in China.
You said：
“If you are mine, what will you choose?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said：
That's a really thoughtful question! If I were in your shoes, I'd probably consider where I feel I can grow the most and where I'd be most comfortable and inspired. Sydney offers that great balance of lifestyle and opportunity, but China could really give you that dynamic
You said：
“No, no, no, no, no. Just say the name of the city. I want to know which wheel you choose.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said：
Got it! If I had to pick one, I’d probably choose Sydney just for the lifestyle and the variety of opportunities there. But it’s definitely a close call!
You said：
“Okay, what should I do now if I want to apply for internships?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said：
A great next step would

00:02
English Conversational Partner said：
No worries! A great next step would be to start building a strong portfolio of your work, especially your photography and social media content. Also, start networking and looking for internship opportunities in Sydney that align with your interests. Let me know if you need any specific tips!
You said：
“But I am consider about my family, will they come to Sydney together or just live at China?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said：
That's definitely an important factor to consider. It might help to have a conversation with your family and see what their thoughts are as well. That way, you can make a decision that feels right for everyone. And of course, I'm here to help with any other details along the way!
You said：
“But my parents definitely can't learn English very well, and they can't communicate with others in Sydney.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said：
I see, that's definitely something to consider. In that case, it might be worth exploring some support or community resources in Sydney to help them adjust. But it sounds like you all have a strong family bond, which will definitely help with the transition. Let me know if you need any more advice on that front!
You said：
“I want to know who else I can talk to for career or study advice at Macquarie University.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely, your university's career services can be a fantastic resource. You can also consider talking to professors in your field, industry professionals, or even alumni from your program. They can offer valuable insights and guidance tailored to your goals. Feel free to reach out to them as well!
You said：
“Okay, thank you for your advice and thank you very much.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said：
You're very welcome! I'm really glad I could help. If you ever have more questions or need any more guidance, just let me know. Have a great day!



TASK 2:
You said：

00:12
English Conversational Partner said：
That sounds like a great plan! It’s always helpful to divide roles clearly. If you need any assistance brainstorming or deciding on those roles, I’d be happy to help!
You said：
“So let's start. Hi, we've just started our group project. Can we plan the tasks together?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely, I'd love to help with that! Let's start by identifying what the main tasks are, and then we can figure out who might be best suited for each one. Sound good?
You said：
“Oh yeah, our assessment is due next week. Can we decide who will do each part?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said：
Of course, that sounds like a great idea! Let's break down the assignment into sections and see what each person’s strengths are. Who wants to start with the first part?
You said：
“I see your point. I think we should represent first so we have more time to read.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said：
That sounds like a great plan! I'll make sure to help you organize everything so you can have that extra time to prepare. Just let me know what specific parts you’d like me to help with!
You said：
“Actually, I am worried about the time.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said：
I totally understand, time can be a bit tight. We'll make sure to divide the tasks efficiently so that everyone has enough time. Let's get started and tackle it step by step!
You said：
“So, who wants to do the writing part?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said：
Alright, let's see who might be interested in taking on the writing part. If you'd like, I can help coordinate and make sure everything flows smoothly! Let me know who’d like to volunteer.
You said：
“Okay, can you do the writing part, please?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely, I'd be happy to help with the writing part! Just let me know the details and the specific points you want included, and I'll take care of it.
You said：
“Okay, so let's add everyone's contact information first and we can set up a group to talk about the tasks.”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said：
That sounds like a great idea! Once we have everyone's contact info, we can set up a group chat or a meeting and get everything organized. I’m looking forward to it!
You said：
“Let's message each other if we run into problems.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely, that sounds perfect! We'll keep the communication open, and if any issues come up, we can sort them out together quickly. Thanks for organizing this!
You said：
“Okay, and should we check in every few days or stay on track?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said：
Got it! I’ll make sure to check in regularly so everything stays on track and we meet our deadline smoothly. Thanks for the teamwork!
You said：
“Maybe, how do we make sure everyone is doing their part fairly is a big problem for us, do you think about it?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said：
That's a really good point. One idea is to set clear, specific milestones and check in on each person's progress regularly. That way, everyone knows what they're responsible for, and we can keep each other accountable in a positive way. Let me know if that sounds good to you!
You said：
“I'm happy to try the presentation, but I have to do it for a lot of times, could I?”

English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely, I totally understand. We can definitely work together to make sure you have enough time to prepare and feel comfortable. Just let me know how I can support you, and we’ll make it work smoothly!
You said：
“Okay, let's start our tasks. And if we have any problems, let's message each other.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said：
Sounds like a plan! I'm excited to get started and see how everything comes together. And of course, just reach out anytime you need a hand. Let’s do this!
You said：
“Okay, this time I'm participating in a feedback session with a teacher, manager, or supervisor. And I'm listening to your communication and ask some questions. So let's start.”
00:18
English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely, I'm here to help you out with that! Just let me know what kind of feedback or questions you have, and we can go from there. Let’s get started!
You said：
“Hi teacher, I've just finished my class presentation. Could you talk about it?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said：
Of course! I’d be happy to give you some feedback. Overall, you did a great job. I really liked how clear and concise your points were. One thing we could improve is maybe adding a bit more detail in the conclusion. How did you feel about it?
You said：
“I think I missed some points, but in general, I did a great job, maybe?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said：
You definitely did a great job! It's completely normal to feel like you might have missed a few points. We can always refine things together, but overall, you did really well. Keep up the good work!
You said：
“Thank you. In the next time, I will make sure to check every point more carefully.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said：
That sounds like a great plan! I'm sure with that extra attention to detail, your next presentation will be even more polished. I'm always here to help, so just let me know!
You said：
“So, what should I change in my presentation, or what point should I add or delete?”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said：
I think focusing on adding a stronger conclusion would be helpful, and maybe adding a bit more detail in a couple of the key points that you felt were a bit rushed. But overall, it was really solid!
You said：
“Could you give me some more advices for my presentation?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said：
Absolutely! One piece of advice is to keep your slides visually engaging but not too text-heavy. Another tip is to practice a few times so you feel confident. And definitely make eye contact with your audience to keep them engaged!
You said：
“Okay, thanks again. This gives me a lot to think about.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said：
You're so welcome! I'm really glad it was helpful. Just take it step by step, and I'm sure your next presentation will be fantastic. And of course, I'm here anytime you need more tips!
You said：
“Thank you very much, teacher.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said：
You're very welcome! It was my pleasure to help. Just let me know if you need anything else, and good luck with everything!
