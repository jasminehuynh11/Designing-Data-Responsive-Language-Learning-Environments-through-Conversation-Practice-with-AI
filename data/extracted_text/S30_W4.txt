WEEK4 – TASK 1: 

Você disse:

Hello, I am student business and maybe I need to changing my degree. Could you help me understand my options?”
00:14
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, I’d be happy to help with that! So, to start off, can you tell me what your current degree is in and what kind of field or career you’re interested in switching to? That way, we can explore some options that match your goals.
Você disse:
“So I don't know”
00:01
English Conversational Partner disse:
No worries at all! We can take it step-by-step. Maybe we can start by discussing what you enjoy most about your current studies or what you’re passionate about. That can help us narrow down some possibilities. What do you think?
Você disse:
“Okay, should I do a diploma before a master's degree?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner disse:
That’s a great question! It definitely depends on your current background and the field you’re aiming for. Sometimes a diploma or a graduate certificate can help build a foundation before pursuing a master's. Do you have a specific field in mind that you’re considering?
Você disse:
“Ok, I understand.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner disse:
Great! And whenever
Você disse:
“But about the Business Diploma,”
00:04
English Conversational Partner disse:
Got it, that definitely gives you a solid foundation. In that case, we can explore how that diploma might transfer into a bachelor’s or a master’s in another field. Do you have any particular areas or industries you’re interested in, like tech, marketing, or something else?
Você disse:
“Oh, alright. I hadn't considered that before. Thanks for your time. I'll look into those options.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner disse:
You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. If you have any more questions as you explore your options, just let me know. Good luck with everything!
Você disse:
“Yes, I have one more question. If I want to study oversize later, how can I prepare now?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner disse:
That’s a great question! A good start would be to research universities or programs abroad and understand their entry requirements. Also, building your English proficiency through tests like the IELTS or TOEFL can help. And of course, looking into scholarships or funding options can be really useful. Anything specific you’re curious about?
Você disse:
“Ok, no, but the last questions, what types of jobs are common for people in my degree?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely! With a business diploma, you could look into roles like business analyst, marketing coordinator, sales associate, or even administrative roles. It really depends on your interests and any additional skills you might have. If you have a particular area you’re leaning toward, we can definitely explore that further!
Você disse:
“Perfect. Thank you so much.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner disse:
You’re so welcome! I’m glad I could help. If anything else comes up, just let me know. Good luck with everything!
Você disse:
“Okay, for now, that's it. I appreciate your help.”

Você disse:
“So, hi, we have just started your group project, can we plan the tasks together?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, that sounds great! Let’s dive into it. What kind of tasks or goals do you have in mind for the project?
Você disse:
“Oh, perfect. I think we should present first so we have more time to write after.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner disse:
That sounds like a solid plan! So, who do you think will take the lead on the presentation portion, and what topics do we want to cover first?
Você disse:
“Can I take notes while someone else presents?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, that's a great idea! That way we can keep everything organized. Who would you like to have present first, and do you have any particular points you want to make sure we include?
Você disse:
“Okay, maybe you can present first while I take notes.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner disse:
That works perfectly fine! I’ll kick things off, and then you can jot down the key points. Is there a specific area you want me to focus on first in the presentation?
Você disse:
“Ok, então...”
00:01
English Conversational Partner disse:
Sounds good! Just let
Você disse:
If someone can’t meet the deadline, how should we handle that?
00:06
English Conversational Partner disse:
That’s a great question! I think we can discuss it as a team and maybe set up some backup plans or redistribute tasks if needed. How do you feel about setting up regular check-ins to keep everyone on track?
Você disse:
“Ok, do you think we need a shared document to manage text keys? Because I think it is a good idea.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, a shared document would be really helpful for keeping everything organized and transparent. Let’s definitely set that up so everyone can access it easily. Sound good to you?
Você disse:
“So perfect.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner disse:
Great! I’m glad we’re on the same page. If you need any help setting that up or have any other ideas, just let me know!
Você disse:
Thanks so much! See you.
English Conversational Partner disse:
Sure — thanks, and see you!

WEEK4-TASK 3:
Você disse:
“Hello, I have...”
00:02
English Conversational Partner disse:
Hello! I’m here to help. What kind of scenario are you interested in practicing today? Let me know, and we can jump right into it.
Você disse:
“Hi, I have just finished my class presentation. Could you talk about it?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely! I'd love to hear about it. What was your class presentation about, and what kind of details would you like to discuss or practice?
Você disse:
“I'm sorry, I don't understand. Can you repeat, please?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner disse:
Of course! No worries at all. I was just asking about your class presentation. What topic did you present on, and what would you like to talk about or practice related to it?
Você disse:
“Yes, I have just finished my class appreciation and I would like, what do you think about my appreciation? So could you talk about it?”
00:18
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, I'd be happy to! If you'd like, you can share some details about your presentation, like the main topic, the key points you covered, or any part you're unsure about. Then we can talk through it and practice together.
Você disse:
“So, do you mean I should change something?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner disse:
Yes, exactly! If you want to share any part of your presentation or any specific section you’re curious about, I’m happy to give feedback or help you refine it. Just let me know what you need.

Você disse:
“So I think he...”
00:02
English Conversational Partner disse:
No worries at all! Take your time.
Você disse:
“You don't understand about I talk, so I told for you about my presentation, but fiction presentation. You only need speak about this. I don't have real presentation.”
00:32
English Conversational Partner disse:
Oh, I see! That makes perfect sense. So, we’re doing a fictional presentation scenario. Got it! In that case, feel free to let me know the topic or any details you have in mind, and we can practice that scenario together.
Você disse:
“So, don't have TopKey because it's a fiction presentation, understand?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, I understand now! We can just create a fictional topic and run through it as if it were real. So, if you’d like, you can pick any subject or scenario, and we can have a fun, interactive practice session with it.
Você disse:
Transcrição indisponível
00:01
English Conversational Partner disse:
Perfect! Whenever you're ready, just let me know the fictional scenario or any details you want to include, and we'll get started right away. This is going to be fun!
Você disse:
“So...”
00:00
English Conversational Partner disse:
All right, sounds good!
Você disse:
“The presentation is about the sky.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner disse:
That’s awesome!
Você disse:
“What do you think about it?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner disse:
I think it’s a really fascinating topic! There’s so much you can explore, from the concept of parallel worlds to the different storytelling elements. I’d love to hear more about what you covered in your presentation and any aspects you’d like to dive deeper into!
Você disse:
“What would you recommend I focus on improving next time?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner disse:
That’s a great question! I’d recommend focusing on clarity and structure, making sure your main points are well-organized. Also, practicing your pacing and engaging your audience with questions or examples can be really helpful. Let me know if there’s a specific area you’d like to work on!
Você disse:
“Now, thank you so much. I appreciate your help.”
