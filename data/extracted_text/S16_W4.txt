WEEK 4: ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION
Task 1: Discussing Study or Career Plans with an Advisor
Você disse:
“Hi, Professor. Thank you for your attention. I know you are always busy.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner disse:
Of course, happy to help. So, tell me a bit about what you’re looking into—are you exploring study plans or more focused on future career options right now?
Você disse:
“Hi, I want to talk about my state plans and my future too. Now I'm studying English. At the moment my level is intermediate. I want to do a master's degree in IT and I need your advice if I stay in the correct way. If I do a chemistry course, an IELTS course just for training, or if I do a PhD, what would advise me for my plan to study English with my dreams to do a master's degree?”
00:47
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, I’m glad you’re thinking ahead. So it sounds like you’re on the right track if you’re aiming for a master’s in IT and you're currently at an intermediate English level. Now, let me ask you: do you have any specific universities or countries in mind for your master’s, or are you still open to exploring that?
Você disse:
“I wanted to study Master Degree in UTS, University of Technology, Sydney.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner disse:
All right, UTS, that’s a great choice! So in that case, I’d definitely recommend focusing on whichever English test UTS prefers—often they accept IELTS, so that could be a good one to prepare for. Now, do you need any advice on how to structure your study plan or timeline for that?
Você disse:
“Yes, I need the address for my steplines, please.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely! So, I’d say let’s map out a timeline. Usually, you’ll want a few months to prep for the IELTS if that’s the test you’re taking. So maybe we can lay out a study schedule that mixes your English practice with a bit of IT prep. Now, do you have a target date for when you’d like to start your master’s, so we can work backwards from there?
Você disse:
“Could you repeat what you asked me because I don't listen?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner disse:
Of course! I was just asking if you have a target date for when you want to start your master’s so that we can plan your study timeline around that.
Você disse:
“Could you repeat again, because we have a noise here.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner disse:
Sure, no worries at all! I was just asking if you have a date in mind for when you'd like to begin your master's program. That way, we can plan your study schedule around that goal.
Você disse:
“Our Master Degree Program.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner disse:
Got it, so you're aiming to start your master's program. That’s perfect. We’ll just set up your study timeline so that you’re ready in time for that. So let’s aim to have you comfortable with your English and test prep a few months before your start date. Now, do you feel like you need any specific resources or guidance on what to study each week?
Você disse:
“I think my plan is start the university after one year because I have more one year for studying English in my school. So, I need just advice about if I start for Cambridge course, if I start for IELTS course, if I just study general English. What is the best way for me?”
00:34
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, that makes sense. So with a full year ahead, I'd say if UTS prefers IELTS for admission, it's probably best to focus on that. So you could do general English first and then transition into some IELTS-specific prep as you get closer. Now, does that sound like a plan that would work for you?
Você disse:
“Yes, I need a place to for work as well, because I need maintaining me here, so I need money, I need to pay my school, but it's very difficult for me to study, sorry, work in IT area, because in general, the companies just contract if I can work a full day. If I don't work full day, it's almost impossible. So, in the moment, I have work in companies as a laborer, in construction, as my staff is in big events. What you could advise me about it?”
00:58
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, that’s a really practical concern. So if you need to juggle work and study, I’d say it’s totally fine to keep doing part-time jobs like barista or event work that fit around your schedule. That way you can earn while you improve your English and work toward your master’s goal. And over time, as your English gets stronger, you might find some small IT internships or part-time roles that can fit in. So does that sound like a workable balance for you?
Você disse:
“Oh, I think it's so good.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner disse:
Great! I’m glad that sounds good to you. So we’ll plan on that balance of part-time work and focusing on your English and test prep. And of course, as you get closer to your master's start date, we can fine-tune anything else you need. Anything else on your mind for now?
Você disse:
“Oh, for today it's nice.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner disse:
All right, glad to hear that! Well, we’ve got a good plan in place, and you know where to start. If you need any more advice down the line, just let me know. Otherwise, you're good to go.
Você disse:
“Muito obrigado, professor. Eu realmente apreciei sua atenção.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner disse:
You’re very welcome! I’m always happy to help. Good luck with everything, and we’ll chat again if you need any more guidance. Take care!
Você disse:
“Take care. Bye-bye.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner disse:
Bye! Take care and best of luck with everything.



























Task 2: Participating in Group Decisions and Negotiating Responsibilities

“Hello people, we needed to discuss the presentation of the new app project to investors. We needed to divide the tasks. Would you like to hear my suggestion?”
00:17
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, let’s hear them. I’m all ears for your suggestions on how we can split things up for the presentation.
Você disse:
“Ok, então, como o proprietário do projeto, posso abrir as apresentações, introduzir todos os membros do projeto e, finalmente, o propósito da aplicação. Depois, acredito que Elton pode falar sobre as mudanças tecnológicas e as ferramentas de IT que serão usadas. Depois, acredito que o Alexandre apresentará os custos do projeto e, finalmente, o Shun apresentará o protótipo com as funcionalidades.”
00:46
English Conversational Partner disse:
Sure, that sounds like a solid plan! I’m happy to jump in and talk about the prototype and the functionalities at the end. So I’m definitely on board with that. Is everyone else comfortable with their parts, or should we tweak anything?
Você disse:
“I want to listen about what you think about my proposal.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, I think your proposal is really well structured. It makes sense to have you kick things off and then have each person present their own area of expertise. So from my side, I’m totally on board with it. Does anyone else have any adjustments, or are we good to lock it in?
Você disse:
“Do you have any two-bit about your part of the project? And you can do your presentation and send for me just for I check if you say okay with the project. And all members of the group, I need to receive this information too. Because it's good if our presentation stay in the same direction. Are you concordant with me? Are you okay?”
00:48
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, I agree with you. It’s a great idea for all of us to share our parts in advance so we can make sure everything lines up nicely. I’ll definitely send you my portion of the presentation so you can review it, and we can all stay on the same page. Does that sound good to you?
Você disse:
“Oh, it's good. I really appreciate it. Could you talk about your idea for this project?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner disse:
Sure thing! I’d be happy to share my idea. So for this project, I’m thinking we can really highlight the most user-friendly features of the app when I present the prototype. That way the investors get a really clear picture of what makes it stand out. And of course, I’ll sync up with everyone else’s sections so it all flows smoothly. Does that align with what you had in mind?
Você disse:
“Oh good, you have a good, you understand the best the project. So I think we can go to work and preparing the presentation and the next week we have a meeting with the investors.”
00:30
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, that sounds like a plan. We understand the project well, and we can all just get to work on our parts. So let’s do that, and then we’ll come together next week for the investor meeting. Sounds great!
Você disse:
“Good. Thanks so much. The meeting is finishing and I hope all of you have a great day. And I really appreciate your attention and I hope you have a great day.”
00:21
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, thanks a lot! It was a great meeting, and I hope you have a fantastic day as well. We'll catch up soon!
Você disse:
“See you soon, people.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner disse:
See you soon! Take care and have


Task 3: Responding to Feedback or a Performance Review
“Hello, teacher. I received information that you wanted to speak with me. It's right?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, that’s right. Thanks for coming in. I just wanted to chat a bit about your recent assignment and give you some feedback. So let’s start with what you did well and then we can go over a couple of things to work on. How does that sound?
Você disse:
“조금 천천히 말씀해 주실 수 있을까요?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner disse:
Of course, I’ll slow down. So first, I’ll share what you did well on your assignment, and then we’ll talk about a couple of areas for improvement. Does that sound good to you?
Você disse:
“Okay, could you start?”
00:02
English Conversational Partner disse:
Sure! So, to start off, you did a really good job with clearly organizing your main points. That was definitely a strong part of your assignment. Now, one area we could work on is adding a bit more detail to your examples. But overall, you’re on the right track. Do you have any questions about that so far?
Você disse:
“Now, I will do more examples. Thank you for your appreciation for my improvement, and I want to talk more about it.”
00:15
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, happy to dive in a bit more. And it’s great to see you’re keen on adding more examples—that’ll definitely strengthen your work. So if you want, we can talk about some specific parts where you might add those examples or any other areas you’d like more feedback on. Just let me know!
Você disse:
“Could you repeat, please?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner disse:
Of course! So it's great that you want to add more examples, and we can definitely talk about where to include them. Just let me know if there’s any specific part you’d like more feedback on, and we can go from there.
Você disse:
“Could you talk about my listening? You have checked if I improved my skills from listening? Or if your perception, I don't have improved these days?”
00:27
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, we can talk about that. I've definitely noticed some improvement in your listening skills. You've been more attentive and responsive during our discussions, which is great. I’d say just keep practicing and you'll continue to see progress. Does that help answer your question?
Você disse:
“How did you think about my score in my test last week?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner disse:
I think you did quite well on your test last week overall. Your score showed that you've improved in a lot of areas, especially in understanding the main ideas. There's always a bit of room to grow, but you're definitely on the right track. If you want, we can talk about any specific parts of the test that you found challenging.
Você disse:
“We could talk a little more about the listening test. What should I do to improve my listening skills?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, we can talk more about that. So to improve your listening skills, I’d suggest practicing a bit each day with different types of audio—like podcasts or news clips—and maybe focusing on understanding the overall message first. Then you can work on catching more details. Over time, that’ll really help you get more comfortable. Does that sound like a good plan to you?
Você disse:
“Oh, thank you, teacher. And talk about my reading test.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner disse:
Of course! So for your reading test, you did a good job with identifying the main ideas in the passages. One thing we can work on is maybe focusing a bit more on understanding the finer details and inference questions. But overall, you’re making good progress. Let me know if you have any specific questions about that!
Você disse:
“Please, could you repeat, please, because there are mice close to me?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner disse:
Of course, I'll repeat that. For your reading test, you did well with finding the main ideas. We can just work a bit more on the details and inference questions. Overall, you're making good progress. Let me know if that helps!
Você disse:
“Yes, it's a pity game because that Alice is so nice and close to me.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner disse:
Of course, no problem at all. So basically, you did well with the main ideas in your reading test, and we can just focus a bit more on the detailed questions and inferences. Overall, you're making good progress. Let me know if that makes sense now!
Você disse:
“I think my reading isn't really my biggest problem. What I've had more difficulty has been listening.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner disse:
Absolutely, that makes sense. If listening is more of a challenge for you, we can definitely focus on that more. We’ll keep working on some daily listening practice and breaking things down into manageable steps. Over time, that should help build your confidence. So we’ll put a little extra focus there!
Você disse:
“Teacher, what is the best thing to study in grammar to improve my writing?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner disse:
I’d say the best thing is to focus on one grammar topic at a time and then practice it in your writing. For example, if you're working on verb tenses, try writing a few sentences each day using that tense. Over time, that kind of focused practice will really help improve your writing. Let me know if that helps!
Você disse:
“I really appreciated your feedback and I hope you have a great day!”
00:05
English Conversational Partner disse:
You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. You have a great day as well, and if you need any more feedback, just let me know.
Você disse:
“No, it's okay, Tejas. Thank you so much.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner disse:
You’re very welcome! Thanks for the chat and have a wonderful day!
