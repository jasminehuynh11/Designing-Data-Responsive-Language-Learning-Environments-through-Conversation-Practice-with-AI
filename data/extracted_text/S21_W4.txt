00:16
English Conversational Partner の発言：
That’s a great consideration! Gaining some work experience can definitely help you build practical skills and enhance your resume. We can look at internship opportunities or part-time roles that align with your interests. Would you like to explore some specific options or industries for that?

“But just imagine now, so I don't have some details about it.”

00:19
English Conversational Partner の発言：
Absolutely, that makes sense! We can definitely break down the tasks and assign them based on everyone’s strengths. Do you have any preferences for which part you’d like to handle, or should we start by listing out all the tasks first?

00:25
English Conversational Partner の発言：
Absolutely, that makes sense! I’ll check in with the rest of the team to see what days work best for them, and then we can find a time that’s convenient for everyone. I’ll keep you updated, and we’ll make sure to find a good time that works for all of us!
You:

00:08
English Conversational Partner の発言：
Yes, that’s correct! Everyone seems on board with the plan and the timeline, and we’re all set to move forward. If anything comes up, we’ll adjust as needed, but I think we’re in a great place.
You:
“Okay, so if any issues come up, let's update each other and let's check our progress in a few days to stay on track.”
00:09

00:06
English Conversational Partner の発言：
Absolutely! One suggestion would be to maybe focus on even more proactive engagement with customers, like checking in with them a bit more frequently to see if they need anything. That small touch can really enhance their experience. How does that sound to you?
You:
“Okay, so how can I suggest some foods or drink?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner の発言：
A great way is to keep it friendly and personal. You could say something like, “If you’re in the mood for something refreshing, I’d highly recommend our special drink today,” or “One of our popular dishes is…” and then name it. It keeps things engaging and helpful!
You:
“Okay, got it. And I have one question, and if I remove some dishes for the end dishes, I don't know how to say that, but the finished dishes, how can I say, can I remove these dishes? Is it okay for you guys or something like that? I always say that. Is it okay?”
