Week 3: Reporting Problems and Seeking Help
Task 1: Reporting an Internet Outage at Your Housing
Hi, today we are going to practice about the reporting problems and the cycling help. Would you help me? You are the role for the staff and I will ask you some questions.”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I'd be happy to help! So, I'll take on the role of, say, a customer service representative, and you can let me know what kind of problem or situation you have in mind. Just go ahead and start whenever you're ready!
You said:
“Yeah, thank you. Hi, my internet has stopped working. Could you help me?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, I’m sorry to hear that your internet’s down. Of course, I can help. Could you let me know if you’ve noticed any error messages or if there’s a specific time that the internet stopped working?
You said:
“There is no signal in my apartment, so I cannot use the Wi-Fi.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense. Thanks for letting me know. And just to check, have you tried restarting your router or modem, or is it something that you haven’t attempted yet?
You said:
“Yes, I'm trying to restart my router and it still cannot working.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
I see, that can be frustrating. Alright, let me ask then: have you noticed if any other devices are also affected, or is it just one device that’s having trouble connecting?
You said:
“Sorry, I cannot understand.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! Let me rephrase that. Are you experiencing the internet issue on just one device, like your phone or laptop, or are multiple devices in your apartment having trouble connecting?
You said:
“I think it's not, just no have any signal. Could you give me some support? Is there have any engineer there? Can they come to this area to check my internet?”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I can definitely help arrange that. Just to confirm, can you let me know your address or the location so that we can schedule a technician to come out and check everything for you?
You said:
“Can we have a video phone call, and I show you, and you tell me how can I fix it.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, that sounds like a great idea! We can definitely arrange a video call. Could you let me know a convenient time for you, and then we can set that up and walk through everything together?
You said:
“Yeah, I think now we can try it, and what should I do first?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! To start, I’ll just need you to make sure that your device’s camera and microphone are working. Then we can connect via a video call app. Once we’re on the call, I’ll guide you step-by-step. Sound good?
You said:
“Yes, thank you. All good.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! Alright, whenever you're ready, just let me know, and we’ll get everything set up. Looking forward to helping you sort this out!
You said:
“Okay, I'm getting ready, so what should I do for next?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Great! So, the next step would be to open up the video call app that we’ll use and make sure your camera and mic are enabled. Once you’re ready, just send me the invite, and we’ll go from there. Let me know if you need any help along the way!
You said:
“Yes, I'm ready. So I already opened my video camera and my microphone. So what should I do? How can I do the router? Should I renew again, or what should I do?”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
Awesome, that sounds perfect! So, let’s start by checking the router’s lights to see if anything looks off. You can point the camera at the router, and I’ll guide you step-by-step. If needed, we can try rebooting it once more, and I’ll let you know what to look for. Sound good?

No worries at all! I’m really glad we got it sorted out. And definitely, just let me know if anything comes up again. Have a fantastic weekend!
You said:
“No, no, no, no, no. Sorry, I mean, if they have a problem again, can I call you on weekend?”
00:07

Task 2: Reporting a Lost Item or Filing a Minor Police Report
You said:
“Hi, I'm going to practice the reporting a lose item. And now you are the police and I'm losing my wallet. Can we have a lose conversation to practice?”
00:15
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I’d be happy to help! Let’s get started. So, to begin, could you tell me when and where you last saw your wallet?
You said:
“Okay, I just lost my student ID card and driving license. Actually, I lost a bag. So inside I have my wallet and $5.”
00:18
English Conversational Partner said:
I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s get all the details we need. Could you let me know where you last remember having your bag, and when that was? That’ll help us figure out the next steps.
You said:
“Hi, today I bring it to the library, and when I went to bathroom, toilet, when I come back, my bag is gone.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
I’m really sorry to hear that happened. All right, let’s note that down. Could you also describe the bag for me, including its color, brand, and any distinctive features? That’ll help us with the report.
You said:
“Okay, on my back, they have a lot of king rings, like the Mickey Mouse or like the LaBaboo. And they have one, the black one, no any color, just black. And they're not so big, just maybe just 23”
00:26
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that’s really helpful. Thank you for the details! Now, could you also let me know if there were any witnesses around or if you’ve already checked with the library staff? That way, we can gather as much info as possible.
You said:
"Yes, I've confirmed with the library staff. Unfortunately, they don't have CCTV in this area, so I didn't receive any notification because they didn't notice who took my bag."
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
I understand, that’s unfortunate.

00:18
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s great information. Along with the time, if you remember any specific landmarks or people you might have interacted with around that time, that would definitely help. And of course, if you think of anything else later on, just let me know. We’ll do our best to assist!

Task 3: Requesting Maintenance or Repairs in a Rental Property
You said:
“Hi, I'm going to practice about the repair in the rental poverty, and I'm a renter. You are maybe the starter, so now we can have a conversation.”
00:15
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds great! I’m ready to help. So, as the strata manager, feel free to let me know what kind of repair issue you’re facing, and we’ll go from there. What’s the problem you need help with?
You said:
“Oh no, my heater in my bedroom isn't turning on, and then my fridge is making a loud noise and not cooling.”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
I’m sorry to hear that! Let’s start with the heater. Could you tell me if it’s completely unresponsive or is it just not heating up properly? And for the fridge, do you know if it’s been making this noise for a while, or is it recent?
You said:
“I think the heater, I'm not so sure I open it, but it's not getting hot, and the fridge is just, I just move in for my first day, and I'm not so sure it's my problem.”
00:25
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense. For the heater, it could be something like a power issue or a thermostat problem. And for the fridge, since you just moved in, it might be that it just needs some adjustment or maybe it’s an existing issue. We can definitely arrange for a maintenance check. Could you let me know when would be a good time for someone to come by?
You said:
“Oh yeah, can someone come today?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can definitely arrange that. I’ll check the schedule and see if someone can come over today. Could you let me know what time works best for you, and if there's any specific details we should know?
You said:
“Mm, all good. Today I'm all free, so I will stay at home.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, that makes it easy! I’ll arrange for someone to come by today, and we’ll get both the heater and the fridge checked out. If anything changes, just let me know, and we’ll make it as convenient as possible for you.
You said:
“Okay, and should I turn off the power for all of the things, or I just keep running?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
It’s usually a good idea to turn off the power to the heater for safety, especially if it’s not working properly. For the fridge, you can keep it running if it’s still cooling adequately, but if the noise is really loud or concerning, you can unplug it temporarily. Just let us know how you’d like to handle it, and we’ll guide you through it.
You said:
“Oh, OK, yeah. Oh, sorry. In this afternoon, 6 PM, I need to pick up my son. So should I leave a kid at the reception if I'm out?”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, that would be perfect. You can leave a key at the reception, and that way the maintenance team can access your unit even if you’re not home. Just let them know at the reception, and we’ll make sure everything goes smoothly.
You said:
“Okay, and would you send the pumper or the handling man here?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely!
You said:
“Thank you.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
We'll make sure to send a qualified technician or maintenance professional who can handle both the heater and the fridge issues. We'll coordinate everything, so you don’t have to worry. If you have any other preferences, just let me know!
You said:
“After we check, could you send me a confirmed machine when the repair is scheduled?”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I'll make sure to send you a confirmation once everything is scheduled. That way, you'll know exactly when to expect the technician. If you have any other questions or need anything else, just let me know!
You said:
“Okay, and I just heard my neighbor, they have the same neighborhood, they have the same question, and can they have at the same time and check with me?”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can coordinate that as well! If your neighbor has similar issues, we can arrange for the technician to come at the same time or back-to-back. Just let me know their details, and we’ll make sure everything’s synchronized so it’s convenient for both of you.
You said:
“Yeah, I know my neighbor who also complained to me it happened the second time in this month.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, I see, that definitely sounds frustrating. In that case, we can prioritize both of your units and ensure that the repairs are done efficiently. Feel free to share your neighbor’s contact details as well, and we’ll coordinate everything seamlessly.
You said:
“OK, yeah, cool. And then should I give you more detail about my unit, or you already got my information?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
I have the basic details for now, but if there’s anything specific about your unit, like the model of the heater or fridge, or any additional concerns, definitely let me know. That way, we can make sure everything is addressed thoroughly and efficiently. Just let me know what you’d like to share!
You said:
“okay yeah oh my neighbor's my neighbor whose problem is the drying machine”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, thanks for letting me know! We’ll make sure to include the dryer issue in the maintenance visit as well. That way, both your unit and your neighbor’s will be taken care of at the same time. If there’s anything else you think of, just let me know, and we’ll handle it all together!
You said:
“Yeah, and we are worried about any long-term damage. And is there have any emergency number can we call?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I understand your concern. We do have an emergency contact number that you can call if anything urgent comes up. I’ll make sure to provide that to you, and in the meantime, we’ll do everything we can to prevent any long-term damage. Just let us know if you need that emergency number, and we’ll get it to you right away.
You said:
“Okay, please tell me your emerging number.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! The emergency contact number is [insert number here]. You can call this line anytime, and we’ll ensure that someone gets back to you promptly. And of course, if you have any other questions or concerns, just let me know!
You said:
“In coding midline,”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely! The emergency number is available 24/7, so you can reach out any time, even at midnight. We’re always here to help and make sure everything’s taken care of for you.
You said:
“Okay, yeah, perfect, thank you. See you, and if I have any update, please let me know.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! I’ll keep you updated, and if you need anything at all, just reach out. Thanks so much, and take care! Goodbye for now!
