TASK 1: 
You said: 
“Hello, my internet has stopped working.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh no, that sounds frustrating! Let's see how I can help. Could you tell me if you're getting any error messages or if the connection is down on all devices?
You said:
“I don't know, but is there a technician available today?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can definitely arrange that. Could you let me know your location and the best time for the technician to come by?
You said:
“Okay, I can give you later. Can you check if there's an outage in the area?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I can check that for you. Could you please share your internet service provider and maybe your zip code so I can look into that?
You said:
“Okay, thank you. And do I need to reset the modem again?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
It might help, yes! Sometimes a quick reset can fix things. Would you like some step-by-step instructions on how to do that?
You said:
“Oh, that's good. Thank you.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
You're welcome! Alright, so first, you'll want to unplug the power cable from the modem, wait about 30 seconds, and then plug it back in.
You said:
“Okay, unplug the power... what?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Exactly, yes! And then once it restarts, we can check if the connection is back up. Let me know if you need any help along the way!
You said:
“Yes, and then, what's the next step?”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
After it restarts, you can try connecting to the internet again and see if it works. If it doesn't, we can try a few more troubleshooting steps. Let me know how it goes!
You said:
“Okay, please wait.”
00:01

English Conversational Partner said:
All right, sounds good!
You said:
“Do you know what the issue might be?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
It could be a few things, like a temporary outage, or maybe a loose cable, or even something with the modem itself. We can narrow it down as we go along. Just let me know how things look after the reset!
You said:
“Okay, thank you. Oh, but there's no signal in my apartment.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that definitely helps narrow it down. In that case, we might need to check the cables or even see if the modem is placed in a good spot. Let me know if you want any guidance on that!
You said:
“Okay, but it was fine this morning, but now it won't connect.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
I see, that can definitely happen sometimes. It might be something temporary, like a network issue or a signal interference. If you’d like, we can also try some advanced troubleshooting or even contact support together. Let me know what you prefer!
You said:
“Okay, so today there's no technician available.”

You said:
“Okay, so I think tomorrow it's better for me at 10 o'clock. Um, will somebody call me?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! We can arrange for a technician to come by at 10 o’clock tomorrow, and they’ll give you a call beforehand to confirm. That way, you’ll know exactly when they’re on their way. Sounds good?
You said:
“Okay, sounds good. Thank you. I'll call back if it doesn't work in after the technicians come tomorrow.”

English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! If the service
You said:
“By tomorrow, do I get a refund or credit?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s definitely something we can look into. Usually, if there’s an extended outage, you can receive a credit or refund. Once the technician checks it out, we can definitely help you with that process. Just let us know, and we’ll make sure you’re taken care of!
You said:
“Okay, thank you. And also, is it possible to change to a different service plan?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can look into that as well! If you’d like, we can discuss the available service plans and find one that suits your needs better. Just let me know what you’re looking for, and we’ll make it happen!
You said:
“Yeah, maybe I will consider it. And, um...”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Sounds good! Take your time to consider it, and if you have any questions or need any details, just let me know. I’m here to help whenever you’re ready!
You said:
“My husband would, my husband want me to do, to make a complaint. What's the process?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
I understand! We can definitely help with that. Usually, the process involves contacting customer support, providing details of the issue, and then they’ll guide you through the complaint form. If you’d like, I can help you with the steps right now as well. Just let me know!
You said:
“Okay, thank you. But I think maybe just by tomorrow is okay. So I think that's it. Thanks for answering all of the questions and have a good day.”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. If you have any more questions in the future, just let me know. Have a wonderful day, and I’ll talk to you soon!

TASK 2:

You said: 
“Hello, I've lost my wallet at the train station and I would like to make a report.”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! Definitely understand how stressful that can be. You might want to contact the station's lost and found department directly. If you need, I can help you find their contact details or guide you through the process. Let me know how I can assist!
You said:
“Yes, that's really important because I have so many important ID cards inside that. So, it's a black round wallet, and it has some symbols. It's about Chinese, it's about Mandarin symbols on both sides of my wallet. And it also has a key ring with Apple tags.”
00:44
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Got it, that definitely helps narrow it down. I'd recommend contacting the station's lost and found as soon as possible and giving them those details. You might also want to report it to the local police station, especially for the ID cards. Let me know if you need any help with the contact info or anything else!
You said:
“Yes, because I last saw it at the train station around 2 p.m.”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Alright, that's great to know. The more details, the better. Definitely let them know the exact time and location where you last had it. If you need help drafting a report or finding the contact info for the station or local authorities, just let me know!
You said:
“Yes, and I also used it when I had my lunch in the restaurant. I think it's at the corner of New Street and Locke Street.”
00:24
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Got it! That definitely gives more clues. It might be worth checking with the restaurant as well, in case someone found it there. Hopefully, it turns up soon. And if there's anything else I can do to help, just let me know!
You said:
“Yes, I asked them before, but they said they didn't receive any lost items in their restaurant. And what happens if someone finds it?”
00:17
ChatGPT said:
I see, that makes sense. Usually, if someone finds it, they might hand it in to the station's lost and found or to local authorities. It’s also possible they might try to contact you if there's any identifying info. In the meantime, it’s good to keep in touch with both the station and the police, and keep checking in periodically. Hopefully, it’ll turn up soon!
You said:
“Okay, do I need to fill up a form?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Yes, typically, for lost and found reports, you'll need to fill out a form with your contact details, a description of the item, and where and when you lost it. The station or police station will guide you on the exact process. If you want, I can help you find the specific form or details for the location you’re dealing with. Just let me know!
You said:
“Okay, and also how long usually do you keep lost items on file?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
It can vary depending on the location and the policies, but generally, train stations and police stations keep lost items for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. After that period, if the items aren't claimed, they might be donated, auctioned, or disposed of. It’s always good to follow up regularly and stay in contact with them. If you want more precise info, I can definitely help with that too!
You said:
“Okay, and what should I do if I lost it in another city? Because I went to Melbourne last morning, but I forgot whether or not I did use it.”
00:19
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Got it! In that case, it's a good idea to contact the lost and found departments in Melbourne as well, including the train stations and any places you visited, like restaurants or shops. You can also report it to the local police in Melbourne. The process is pretty similar, just make sure to provide as many details as possible. And definitely keep an eye on any updates. If you need help connecting with specific places in Melbourne, I'm here to help!
You said:
“Okay, so next I should call them for the report. So, okay, thank you. I'll check back tomorrow and thanks for explaining everything.”
00:14
ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome! I’m glad I could help. Definitely keep me posted, and I hope everything turns up soon. And if you have any more questions or need anything else, just let me know. Good luck, and talk to you soon!
You said:
“Okay, thank you and please call me if it is found.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I'll keep my fingers crossed that it turns up quickly! And if I hear anything, I'll definitely let you know. Take care, and I hope you have a good rest of your day!
You said:
“Okay, thank you. I appreciate your help.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome! I'm always happy to help. If anything else comes up, just reach out anytime. Have a great one!


TASK 3: 
You said: 
“There's a leak under my kitchen sink.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Oh no, that sounds frustrating! Hopefully it's not too serious. Have you had a chance to check where the leak is coming from, or do you need some tips on what to do next?
You said:
“Yes, it's too busy to talk about it, but, um, and still, and also, there's still another problem. My fridge is making a loud noise and it's not cooling.”
00:12
ChatGPT said:
Oh, that definitely sounds like a double headache! Hopefully, we can get both things sorted out soon. If you need any troubleshooting tips or guidance on either the leak or the fridge, just let me know.
You said:
“Can someone come today or tomorrow?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! For plumbing, Proximity Plumbing offers 24/7 emergency service with a 30-minute response time. And for your fridge, Fridges R Us can also provide urgent repairs. So you should be able to get someone out either today or tomorrow! 
You said:
“Okay, could they call or text me when they're on their way?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, most of these services do offer that option. When you book an appointment, you can usually request a call or a text notification when they're on their way. Just let them know your preference when you contact them, and they'll make sure to keep you updated!
You said:
“Okay, and I think I should turn off the water until they come, right?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Yes, that's definitely a good idea. Turning off the water will help prevent any further damage and keep things under control until the plumber arrives. Hopefully, that'll make things a bit easier and less messy!
You said:
“Okay, and I'll leave a key at reception if I'm out.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a great plan! That way, they can still get in and take care of everything even if you're not home. Hopefully, it'll all be sorted out quickly and smoothly!
You said:
“Is there anything I should prepare before they arrive?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
It might help to clear out the area under the sink so they have easy access, and maybe move any items away from the fridge as well. It’s also good to have your details ready, like any warranty info for the fridge or any past plumbing details. And just make sure you’re reachable if they have any questions!
You said:
“Okay, so can you send me a confirmation because my repair is scheduled?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
Of course! Once you've booked the appointment, I'll be sure to help you keep track of it and send you a confirmation. Just let me know once you’ve arranged everything, and I'll make sure you're all set!
You said:
“And I'd like to follow up as there's no one came today.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Got it! I’ll make a note of that, and if anything comes up and no one shows up, we can definitely follow up and make sure everything's on track. Let me know if you need anything else!
You said:
“And also, I think this is the third time it's happened. Can it be checked more thoroughly?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Absolutely, I’ll make sure to note that so the technician can do a more thorough inspection this time. Hopefully, that’ll help prevent it from happening again in the future! Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to add.
You said:
“Okay, and should I be worried about any longer, uh, long d— long-term damage?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
It definitely depends on how severe the leak and the fridge issue are. If it's been happening multiple times, it could potentially lead to some long-term damage, like mold growth or structural issues with the cabinets. It's definitely good to get everything checked thoroughly so you can catch any potential issues early on. If you’re concerned, it’s always good to mention it to the professionals so they can keep an extra eye on things.
You said:
“Okay, that's really bad. Um, is there an emergency number I can call on weekends?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Yes, absolutely! Most plumbing and appliance repair services have emergency hotlines that are available 24/7, including weekends. I can look up some local emergency numbers for you if you'd like!
You said:
“Okay, thanks for organizing that so quickly.”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome! I'm always here to help. Just let me know if you need anything else, and I hope everything gets sorted out smoothly for you!
You said:
“Okay, thank you, bye, have a good day.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
You too! Take care and have a wonderful day. Bye for now!
Task 4: 
You said: 
“Hey!”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Hey! Great to hear
You said:
“I can't open this application. It crashes every time.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Oh no, that sounds frustrating! Have you tried any troubleshooting steps yet, like restarting the device or updating the app?
You said:
“Nah, not really, I'm not a tech-savvy person, and also my internet browser won't load anything.”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Gotcha, that definitely makes things trickier. We can try some simple steps, like clearing the browser cache or maybe even reinstalling the app. And if you want, I can help guide you through it step-by-step.
You said:
“Okay, thank you. I'll try it.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You're welcome! Just let me know how it goes, and if you run into any issues, I'm here to help. Hopefully, it'll get sorted out quickly!
You said:
“Oh, OK. So I've got some reply. I've got some notification. And I've tried restarting it already.”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
Got it! If you've already tried restarting, we can look into a few more things. Maybe checking for updates or disabling any extensions in the browser. And if you share a bit more detail about the app or the browser, I can try to give more specific suggestions.
You said:
“Okay, I think the message, the notification says connection failed. What does that mean?”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
Ah, gotcha! A "connection failed" message usually means the app or browser is having trouble reaching the internet or the server it needs. It could be due to a weak internet connection, a firewall issue, or even a problem with the app's server. We can definitely troubleshoot from there!
You said:
“Okay, and since I've got this smartphone for maybe 5 or 6 years, should I update the software?”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, definitely! If your smartphone's been around for that long, updating the software can really help with performance and compatibility. It often fixes bugs and improves stability, so it’s definitely worth doing if you haven’t already.
You said:
“Okay, got it. And where can I find that option in the menu?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Usually, you can find it in your phone's settings under something like "Software Update" or "System Update." If you let me know what kind of smartphone you have, I can give you more detailed instructions as well.
You said:
“Okay, I'll try. And is this covered up?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Sure, I’m happy to help! If you let me know what exactly you're wondering about, like whether it’s covered under warranty or something else, I can definitely give you more info.
You said:
“If I send to the repair center, is this covered under warranty or do I need to pay for repairs?”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
It really depends on the warranty status and the specific issue. If your phone is still under warranty and the problem is due to a manufacturing defect, then it might be covered. But if it’s due to accidental damage or something out of warranty, you might have to pay. It’s always good to check the terms
You said:
“Okay.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely!
You said:
“Okay, got it. What happens if it's not fixed after trying these steps?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:
If it’s still not fixed after trying those steps, you might want to consider reaching out to customer support or even taking it to a professional repair center. They might be able to diagnose the issue more thoroughly, and sometimes there could be a deeper problem that needs specialized attention. But hopefully, we can get it sorted before it gets to that point!
You said:
“Do I need to worry about any security risks?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
It can depend on the situation, but generally, if an app or device isn't updated or is having connectivity issues, there can be some security vulnerabilities. It’s always good to make sure your software is up-to-date and that you’re using trusted networks. If you’re concerned, we can definitely look into more security measures as well.
You said:
“Because I'm concerned about my files or photos will be deleted. So is there a way to back up before I reset the phone?”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, backing up is definitely a smart move. You can back up your photos and files to a cloud service, like Google Photos or iCloud, or even use a computer to create a manual backup. That way, even if something goes wrong, your data will stay safe and sound. Let me know if you need any guidance on how to do that!
You said:
“Okay, so what if this problem keeps happening after today?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
If the problem persists, it might be worth reaching out to the manufacturer’s support or even considering a professional diagnostic. They can often run more in-depth checks and see if there’s a hardware issue. And if it’s still under warranty, they might offer a replacement or a more permanent solution. But we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it!
You said:
“Also, because I've dialed to the previous repair center that didn't fix it as the same level as before, so who do I contact if I want to make a complaint?”
00:24
ChatGPT said:
Got it, that can definitely be frustrating. Usually, you can reach out to the manufacturer’s customer support directly, or sometimes the retailer where you bought the device. You can also ask to speak with a manager or escalate the complaint. And if needed, there are also consumer protection agencies that can help as well. Let me know if you need more specific guidance!
You said:
“Okay, thanks, and I'll reach out again if I still have problems.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Of course! Anytime, I’m always here to help. Just let me know how it goes, and I’ll be happy to assist further. Good luck, and I hope everything gets sorted out smoothly!
You said:
“Thanks for your help and I'll try those steps you provide. Thanks for answering my all questions.”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. And if you have any more questions or need anything else, just let me know. Good luck with everything!
You said:
“Okay, thank you. Have a good night.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You too! Have a great night, and take care. Talk to you soon!
