Hi Tonic, I'm sorry to hear that you've been having trouble for so long. Could you describe a bit more about what happens when you try to connect?
You said:
“Like these times, many times, I guess, I play video games, but the internet is always not working, and it's been about a week I'm calling your office service many times, but every time I call, I'm told that someone else is responsible. Honestly, I'm getting really frustrated.”

I completely understand your frustration, Tonic, and I do apologize for the inconvenience. Let me take full responsibility and help you out now. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps so far, like restarting the modem or checking the cables?
You said:
“Um, last time I called you guys, you guys just told me about I need to re-record, re-sign the mobile on the Wi-Fi, but I really need to do face-to-face as soon as possible. And this issue continues and no one takes the responsibility. I have to change another Internet company. And again, I do try what you guys tell me to do, but I really need someone to go into my house to face them. Any engineer, any support, please, please, if you guys are not doing that, I'm going to change the Internet company.”
