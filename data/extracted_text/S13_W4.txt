You said:
“Yeah, you will be a university advisor.”

English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, I can do that! As a university advisor, I'm here to help with course selection, academic planning, and anything else you need. Just let me know what you'd like to focus on, and we'll get started!
You said:
“Yes, the scenario is that I have been working part-time in hospitality, but I would like to try something new.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense! So, are you looking to shift your major or explore a different field of study? Let me know what kind of areas you're interested in, and we can go from there!
You said:
“Actually, I have a background in business and insurance.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, that's great! With a background in business and insurance, there are definitely a lot of pathways we can explore. Are you considering something like finance, marketing, or maybe even something entirely different? Let me know!
You said:
“Could you give me more information about each one?”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! I can definitely provide more details. For example, finance often involves things like banking, investment analysis, and financial planning. Marketing focuses on branding, advertising, and market research. And then, of course, there are plenty of other fields we could look into as well. Is there a particular area that catches your interest first?
You said:
“I'm not sure.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
That's totally fine! We can definitely explore your interests together. Maybe we can start by looking at what you enjoy most about your current work or what skills you’d like to develop, and then go from there. Sound good?
You said:
“Yes, of course.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Awesome! So, let’s start with what you enjoy most about your current work in hospitality. Is it the customer interaction, the fast-paced environment, or something else? That can help us figure out which direction might be a great fit for you.
You said:
“Well, I really like the customer experience, to talk with people, to help them.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s fantastic! It definitely sounds like you have a passion for customer relations. In that case, we could look into fields like marketing, hospitality management, or even customer service in different industries. Let me know if any of those sound intriguing, and we can dive deeper!
You said:
“Could you repeat that?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a plan! We can explore those options in more detail and see which one aligns best with your goals. Just let me know whenever you're ready, and we’ll get started on narrowing things down!
You said:
“I am ready.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Awesome, let's do it! So, to get started, maybe we can look at your current skills and experiences and see how they translate into those new fields. What do you think your top strengths are that you'd like to bring along?
You said:
“But do you think what?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
I’d say your strong interpersonal skills and your customer-focused mindset are
You said:
“All right, thank you.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Exactly! Those qualities are definitely valuable in a lot of fields. So, we can definitely leverage that as we explore new opportunities. Let me know if there's a particular industry or role you’re curious about, and we’ll dive deeper into that!
You said:
“queries in a specific role.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I'd love to help with that! Just let me know which role or industry you have in mind, and we can go over what that entails, the skills needed, and how your background can fit in. Whenever you're ready, just let me know!
You said:
“I would like to have more information about the insurance industry in Australia.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! The insurance industry in Australia is quite robust, and it covers areas like health, life, property, and general insurance. There's a strong demand for professionals in underwriting, claims management, and customer service. We can definitely explore the specific roles and qualifications needed. Let me know if there's a particular area you want to dive into first!
You said:
“And what if I have an upper-intermediate level of English? Do you think it's enough to work in Australia?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, an upper-intermediate level of English is definitely a solid foundation, especially in the insurance industry. It’s often about clear communication and being able to understand clients and colleagues. With some targeted practice and perhaps a bit of industry-specific vocabulary, you’ll be well-prepared. If you'd like, we can also go over some key terminology and tips to help you feel more confident.
You said:
“Yes, of course.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! We can definitely focus on some key industry terms, common phrases, and ways to communicate effectively in that environment. We can also look at some practice scenarios to build your confidence. Just let me know if there’s any specific area you’d like to start with, and we’ll jump right in!
You said:
“Before that, I would like to know if I need a diploma or study a specific degree in Australia to get a job in this industry.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! In Australia, many roles in the insurance industry do prefer candidates with relevant qualifications, like a diploma or a degree in business, finance, or insurance. That said, there are also entry-level positions that might not require a formal degree, especially if you have relevant experience or strong transferable skills. We can definitely look at specific roles and see what the requirements are for each.
You said:
“Could you give more information about the role of underwriting and claims?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! So, underwriting in insurance involves evaluating risks and determining the terms and pricing of insurance policies. Underwriters analyze information, assess risk factors, and decide whether to provide coverage.
On the other hand, claims roles focus on assisting customers who have experienced a loss. This involves investigating claims, assessing damages, and ensuring that customers are compensated fairly. Both roles are crucial and offer different types of challenges and rewards. Let me know if you’d like more detail on either one!
You said:
“Hmm, that sounds like something I would enjoy.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s fantastic to hear!
You said:
“So, in your opinion, business should be a good degree to get a job in this area.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
In general, a degree in business, finance, or even risk management can be really beneficial for a career in insurance. Many people also pursue specialized certifications, like those offered by the Australian and New Zealand Institute of Insurance and Finance. Ultimately, having a solid business foundation and a good understanding of risk will definitely help you stand out. Let me know if you want more specifics or any guidance on choosing the right path!
You said:
“Yes, what should I do now if I want to apply for internships in that area? Probably next year or two years.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds like a great plan! To get started, you can begin by researching insurance companies and their internship programs and checking their application timelines. It’s also a great idea to build up relevant skills, maybe through online courses or workshops, and also to network with professionals in the field. And of course, updating your resume and highlighting any relevant experience will be key. If you need any guidance along the way, I'm here to help!
You said:
“Ok, you know, I'm very clear now.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s wonderful to hear! I’m really glad we could clarify things for you. If you have any more questions down the line or need further assistance, just let me know. Otherwise, best of luck with your journey into the insurance field!

TASK 2: 
You said:
“Hello?”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Hey there! How can I help you today? Let me know what you'd like to do or talk about, and we'll jump right in.
You said:
“We are going to create a new scenario.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds great! I'm ready whenever you are. Just let me know the kind of scenario you're thinking of, and we can dive right into it.
You said:
“Yes, in this case, you will be... your role will be my team... my teammate.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Awesome, I can definitely do that! So, I'll be your teammate. Just let me know the context—are we working on a project, playing a game, or something else? And we’ll get started from there.
You said:
“Yes, today we need to work in a project together.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! That sounds good to me.
You said:
“We need to discuss about the deadlines and how will be organized the job.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that makes sense! So, let's start by figuring out what the main tasks are and what deadlines we have in mind. What do you think is the first task we should tackle?
You said:
“Well, the deadline is in two weeks.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, two weeks sounds like a solid timeframe. So, let’s break down the tasks and see how we can divide them up. What’s the first major task you think we should focus on?
You said:
“The first step, I think that we need to collect all the data.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, collecting all the data is a great first step. So, let's figure out what kind of data we need and who will be responsible for gathering it. Do you have any specifics in mind for the data we need?
You said:
“I'm thinking that you can collect the data.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Sounds good to me!
You said:
“Like first stage”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I can take care of that initial data collection. So, let me know what specific information you’d like me to gather, and I’ll get started on that. Anything else you want to plan out for now?
You said:
“Yeah, after that, we need to discuss the information, generalize them.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That makes perfect sense! Once we have the data, we’ll dive into analyzing it carefully. So, we’ll plan out the analysis steps once we’ve got everything collected. Sound good?
You said:
“Yeah, and after that we need to have a meeting to discuss the results.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s a great plan! So, after the analysis, we’ll schedule a meeting to go over all the results and decide on the next steps. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to add to our plan for now!
You said:
“Yeah, what do you want to do for the project?”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Well, I’m definitely excited to contribute wherever needed! We could focus on gathering the data first, and then maybe I can help with the analysis or even the presentation of the results. Whatever works best for you! Let me know what you think.
You said:
“Okay, just be sure that all the data you are collecting is about the last quarter.”
