00:24
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I'd be happy to help! Let's get started. Why don't you go ahead and tell me a bit about yourself, like your academic background and your current focus, and then we can craft your introduction together.
You said:
“Yes, actually...”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries, take your time! Whenever you're ready, just share a bit about your academic journey so far, and then we can refine it and make it sound great. Just let me know when you're ready to start.

00:22
English Conversational Partner said:

You said:
“that have points for PR in Australia. And I don't know if there are something that similar to my career, to childhood or maybe childcare.”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. We can definitely look into programs or opportunities that support students who might not have perfect English proficiency yet. We can explore pathways, like English language programs or bridging courses, that can help you get ready. Just let me know what you’re curious about, and we’ll figure it out together!
You said:
“Should I do a diploma before a master's degree?”
00:03

Task 2: Participating in Group Decisions and Negotiating Responsibilities

You said: 

“Hello, now you are a project group member and today we are working on a group project and we need to share opinions, agree or disagree, politely, and negotiate roles, deadlines, or contributions, okay?”
00:25
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I'd be happy to help with that! So, let’s start with the project details. Could you tell me a bit about the project goals and what kind of roles you’re considering for the team?
You said:
“The project is about tasks in English and in our culture. My culture is Colombian culture and your culture is, for example, Australian culture. And we need to compare these cultures and do the contrast and compare.”
00:25
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that sounds really interesting! So, we’ll definitely need roles like cultural researchers, maybe translators, and analysts. Could you let me know what specific roles you're thinking about and what skills or expertise you want for each role?
You said:
“You need to choose the presentation order what do you think works best.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that makes
You said:
“Hello, let's talk about how to, is the, what is the culture, diverse culture, Australian culture, or common culture.”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, we can definitely dive into that. So, let’s start by identifying some of the key cultural elements or values that are unique to each culture. Then we can compare how they might influence communication styles or social norms. Does that sound good to you?
You said:
“Could you repeat the last part?”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! I said: "Then we can compare how they might influence communication styles or social norms." Hopefully that helps!
You said:
“Yes, code will compare the social norms and, for example, different things about the culture. In my culture is normally too... Colombia is really noisy culture and the people is not polite and is unsafe. Not the culture, but the country is unsafe. And, for example, you don't have a cell phone in the street because someone... It's possible that someone stole your phone. And it's possible that the other people hurt yourself with a gun or... I don't know.”
00:52
English Conversational Partner said:
I see what you mean!
You said:
“Yeah, no, no, no. I called you a speck.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! We can definitely explore that further whenever you’re ready. Just let me know what specific aspects you’d like to dive into, and I’m here to help!
You said:
“Maybe could we compare the food? Is different the food in Colombia and is different the food in Australia? What is the main dishes in Colombia? Or what is the main dishes in Australia?”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds like a great
You said:
“In Colombia, for example, we have bandeja paisa, it's rice with beans, with beef, with plátano, with avocado, or arepa, it's really famous, it's a dish, a meal with flavor corn and butter and cheese, and we have ajiaco, it's a soap, we have tamal, or we have lechona, it's a pork, it's delicious, and you call to speak about the food in Australia?”
00:54
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s a wonderful comparison! In Australia, for instance, you might find iconic dishes like meat pies, vegemite on toast, or even the famous barbecue culture. And of course, there are unique dishes like kangaroo steak or pavlova for dessert. It’s fascinating to compare these culinary traditions!

Task 3: Responding to Feedback or a Performance Review

“Now, I am participating in a feedback session with my manager or supervisor in the hotel. You are the supervisor and, for example, it's a week of housekeeping in my hotel, Meridian Hotel, and I start a presentation about the problems and solutions in the hotel.”
00:38

00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! When it comes to handling errors in your presentation, it’s great to stay calm and composed. You can acknowledge the mistake briefly, correct it, and then smoothly continue. It’s also helpful to have some backup notes or key points in mind. We can definitely go over some scenarios and practice together!
You said:
“Ok, sometimes the coworkers don't clean appropriately, and sometimes the rooms are dirty, not so much, too much, but is a little bit. Maybe when you check the rooms, you do a better check, because sometimes when the guests arrive in the hotel, the guests put a complaint about us. And is not the mistake, our mistake for us, and is difficult for us to clean really quickly, with really detail, and you sometimes don't report about our mistakes for fixing that.”
01:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I understand. It's definitely important to be aware of those details and to handle any confusion gracefully. We can definitely practice how to explain things clearly and how to reassure guests if there’s any misunderstanding. We’ll make sure you feel confident and prepared for anything that comes up!
You said:
“What does SUSE look like for this task?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! Usually, it might look like having a clear, concise explanation ready for each room or service, and being able to adapt if a guest has questions. It could also mean having some friendly, reassuring phrases to let them know you’re on top of things. We can definitely role-play some scenarios so you get comfortable with it!
You said:
“Thanks, I'll make sure to check details more carefully the next time and I tell you if I need anything else.”

You said:
“Maybe you should check better the toilets and the kitchen, the glasses, because the glasses have a lot of fingerprints and the mirror have drops in the top sometimes.”
00:19
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great point! It definitely helps to have everything neat and well-organized, and making sure those details are covered can really enhance the guest experience. We can definitely go over some tips and best practices for that as well. Just let me know how you'd like to proceed, and we’ll make it all perfect!
You said:
“What would you recommend? Focus on improving nets.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
I’d definitely recommend focusing on the small details that create a welcoming atmosphere, like ensuring cleanliness, organizing amenities neatly, and maybe adding a personal touch, like a welcome note. Also, paying attention to lighting and making sure everything is well-maintained can make a big difference. And of course, we can fine-tune all these elements together as well!
