You said:
“And also, do you have a cake?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, we do! We have a variety of cakes, like chocolate cake, cheesecake, and some fruit tarts. Is there a particular flavor you’re interested in?
You said:
“私はチョコレートに興味があるので、チョコレートを使わずにケーキを作ってください。”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, no chocolate cake for you! We can definitely do something like a vanilla or a fruit-based cake instead. I’ll make sure it’s all set. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like!
You said:
“Do you have a cheesecake?”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, we absolutely do! We have a delicious cheesecake available. I’ll add that to your order as well. If there’s anything else you’d like to adjust, just let me know!
You said:
“2ピースチーズケーキをください、友達と一緒に。”
00:06

00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can accommodate a wheelchair without any problem. We'll make sure everything is set up so they can be comfortable. Is there anything else you'd like us to prepare?
You said:
“Let's see, so, to be honest, my friend is birthday today, so can you arrange a piece of, no, whole cake?”
00:18
English Conversational Partner said:

TASK3
“Yesterday, I bought a piece of cloth, yet it's rather snug for me, so could you change the size?”
00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, I can help with that. We'll just switch gears a bit. So if it's a bit snug, absolutely, we can arrange a different size for you. Could you let me know what size you'd like instead?
You said:
“この衣装は26サイズなので、27サイズで買えますか?”
00:15
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can swap that out for a size 27 for you. I'll make sure we get that arranged. Anything else you need help with?
You said:
“Ah, so should I admit a receipt?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Yep, if you can just bring the receipt along, that’ll make the size exchange super easy. We'll take care of it from there. Anything else on your mind?
You said:
“Yes, in my wallet, I have a receipt, so immediately we can change it, right?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Exactly, you've got it. If you have the receipt in your wallet, we can do that exchange right away, no problem at all. Just let us know when you're ready.
You said:
“Okay, here is the receipt, the tips.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, got it. With that receipt, we'll just go ahead and get your new size sorted out right away. And you should be all set! Let me know if there's anything else.
You said:
“So, could you tell me your criteria about return?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! Our return criteria are pretty simple: as long as you’ve got the item in its original condition and you have the receipt, we can do the exchange or return within 30 days. So you're all good to go. Anything else you want to ask about that?
You said:
“Yesterday, I bought a hat, but after that, I'm not keen on this hat, so could you return this hat? Of course, I have a receipt.”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can handle that too. If you’re not keen on the hat and you've got the receipt, we can go ahead and process that return for you. Just bring it in and we’ll take care of it. Anything else on your mind?
You said:
“また質問がありますが、貨幣の返済方法はどのようにしているのでしょうか? 私はこのカードを購入し、クレジットカードを使用しました。”
00:23
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, that’s no problem at all. If you paid by credit card, we’ll just refund the amount right back to your card. So once you bring the hat and the receipt in, we'll just credit it straight back to the same card you used. And that’s all there is to it! Anything else you’d like to know?
You said:
“昨日はパンを買いました。”

Absolutely, I get it. If you need to return or exchange those pants as well, we can handle that the same way. Just bring them along with the receipt and
You said:
“Also, this pants is orange, but I don't have a clothing which is suit for this orange pants, so could you change a color?”
00:18
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, we can do that for you as well. If you want to change the color of those pants to something that matches your wardrobe better, just let us know what color you’d like. We’ll be happy to find a better match for you.
You said:
“Let's see, I think, hmm...”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Take your time, no
You said:
“ブラウンやグレーは私にとって最高のシートです。”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
All right, brown or grey it is! We can definitely find you a pair in one of those colors. Just let us know which one you prefer, and we’ll get that sorted out for you.
You said:
“インディビューのコメントをお願いいたします どれがクーラーか、オレンジ色か、黄色か、黄色か、”
00:19
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! So if you're looking for something a bit cooler in tone, I'd say go with the grey. It tends to match a lot of things and gives you that nice neutral vibe. But if you want something a bit warmer, then brown is a great choice. So it really just depends on your style. But either way, we’ll help you out.
You said:
“I have a lot of clothing, which is like cyan, blue, pink, right?”
00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it! So with
You said:
“ブライトカラーはどう思いますか?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, that makes sense. If you've got a lot of bright colors like cyan and pink, I'd say the grey would be a really versatile choice. It's going to complement those brighter colors really easily and not clash. But if you prefer a warmer tone, brown could work too. So I'd lean towards grey for maximum matching.
You said:
“Okay, please grade a pair of pants.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we'll get you a nice grey pair of pants then. That should fit right in with your bright wardrobe. We'll sort that out for you, and you’ll be all set. Anything else you need?
You said:
“Now, I want to buy a watch.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, we can help you with that as well. If you're looking for a belt, just let me know what style or color you have in mind, and we'll find something that suits you.
You said:
“Yes, my budget is about 10,000 yen, and also this watch to use sports, such as tennis, cycling.”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
All right, that sounds good. So with a budget of about 10,000 yen and for casual use like tennis or cycling, we can definitely find you a comfortable and sporty belt that fits that range. We'll pick something out that’s both practical and stylish for you. Let me know if you have any other details in mind!
You said:
“これはビジネスではなくてカジュアルなのですが、 日常使用に最も役立ちます。 学校に行く、運動やスポーツをする、 スポーツをする、 スポーツをする、 スポーツをする、”
00:27
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a great pick. If it’s something that works both casually and a little bit for everyday use, like going to school or doing some sports, that’s perfect. We’ll go with that option. It should fit really well into your daily routine. Let me know if there's anything else you need!
You said:
“I think this is a best choice for me, so can I buy this watch?”
00:06

“Can I use a cache?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, we can do that. You can absolutely pay in cash if that’s easier for you. So just let us know and we’ll handle it that way. Anything else you want to check on?
You said:
“OK, how much is that? I have 10,000 yen.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
All right, no worries. So that watch is actually well within your budget. It comes to about 8,000 yen, so you’ll be comfortably under that 10,000 yen mark. You’re all good to go, and we can do the payment in cash. Anything else you need?
You said:
“Yes, okay. I'm going to buy this watch.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, we’ll get that all set up for you then. So you can go ahead and buy the watch, and we'll ring it up in cash. Thanks so much, and if there's anything else, just let me know!
