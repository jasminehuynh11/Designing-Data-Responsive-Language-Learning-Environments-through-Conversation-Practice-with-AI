Task 1: Discussing Study or Career Plans with an Advisor
“Hi, today we are practice about discussing study or career plan with an advisor.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds great!
You said:
“Could you practice with me? I am a student. You are maybe a professional.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I'd be happy to help! Just let me know what kind of scenarios you'd like to practice, and we can jump right in.
You said:
“Okay, I'm study business, but I'm not sure it is the right fit”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense! We can definitely explore that. So, to start, could you share what your main interests or goals are in business, and what you're hoping to achieve?
You said:
“I have a work part-time in retail, but I would like to try something new, and I'm thinking about changing my degree. Could you help me understand my options?”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I'd love to help! So, let’s talk about what areas of business interest you the most and what kind of roles you’re curious about. That way, we can narrow down the best options for you. What do you think?
You said:
“like the business is like the company b2b or b2c and i'm not so sure now it is really popular in uh have a deal with the internet so like amazon or tiktok we can we can put our product on it and”
00:31
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that makes
You said:
“And I also think maybe in the future I want to study overseas. So could you give me some options?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! That’s exciting. We can definitely explore options that combine business with international opportunities. Let’s look at different fields, like international marketing or e-commerce, and see which ones align with your goals. Sound good?
You said:
“Yeah, what's the difference with international marketing or economic?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! So, international marketing focuses on promoting products and understanding consumer behavior across different countries, while economics is more about studying how resources are allocated and understanding market forces on a broader scale. Both are really valuable, depending on what you’re interested in.
You said:
“Okay, it sounds like economic hurt difficult more and then marketing maybe now is more popular right now, right?”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said:
Yeah, definitely! Marketing tends to be more hands-on and creative, and it’s in high demand, especially with digital platforms growing so quickly. It can definitely be a bit more approachable compared to economics. But we can explore both and see what fits you best!
You said:
“Okay, yeah, let me think. And do you think I need more work experience before I applied overseas university?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great consideration! Gaining some work experience can definitely help you build practical skills and make you a more competitive candidate. But it’s not always mandatory. It really depends on the program and what you’re aiming for. We can definitely look into specific requirements and options together!
You said:
“Okay, what kind of work experience are you looking for?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! Typically, relevant work experience could include internships in marketing, sales, or business development, or even roles in retail management that show leadership and customer interaction. Anything that demonstrates your understanding of business concepts will be helpful. Let me know if any of those sound like a good fit for you!
You said:
“And should I do a diploma before a master's degree or diploma is enough?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
That really depends on your background and your goals. Sometimes a diploma can give you a solid foundation, and then you can jump into a master’s later. But if you already have some relevant experience or a related bachelor’s degree, you might be able to go straight into a master’s program. We can definitely explore what suits you best!
You said:
“But now if I want to find a job, the degree is important for me.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a really good point. In many fields, experience and skills can be just as important, if not more so, than the degree itself. It really depends on the employer and the specific role. Sometimes having a degree can open doors, but it’s definitely possible to get into a great position with the right experience. We can definitely weigh those options together!

English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. Feel free to reach out anytime you have more questions or need more guidance. Best of luck with everything, and I’m sure you’ll do great!
You said:
“Can I ask one more question?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, absolutely! Feel free to ask me anything else that comes to mind, and I'm here to help however I can.
You said:
“How can I decide between doing future study or starting work after graduation?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great question! It often comes down to your long-term goals and what you’re looking to gain. If you’re eager to dive into the workforce and get hands-on experience, starting work right after graduation might be the best choice. On the other hand, if you want to specialize further or open up more advanced career paths, pursuing further study could be beneficial. We can definitely explore what aligns best with your aspirations!
You said:
“If I study marketing in my country, will it be more difficult when I study overseas, like I study diploma in my country and I want to study master's degree overseas, will it be more difficult for me, or they use the science theater?”
00:29
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a really insightful question! In general, it can be a bit more challenging to transition from studying in your home country to studying overseas, mainly because of different academic systems, cultural differences, and sometimes language barriers. However, many programs are designed to support international students, and with the right preparation, it’s definitely manageable. And having that international experience can be really valuable in the long run!
You said:
“If I study overseas, will it be more easier to find a job?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
In many cases, yes, it can definitely help! Studying overseas can give you access to a broader network, exposure to international companies, and often a deeper understanding of global markets. It can definitely enhance your resume and potentially make you more competitive in the job market. But it also depends on the industry and the specific job you’re aiming for. It’s definitely an advantage to consider!
You said:
“In the long term plans, what should I do now if I want to apply for the internship next year?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great step! To get started, I’d recommend identifying the companies or industries that interest you most, and then tailoring your resume and cover letter to highlight relevant experiences. It’s also helpful to start networking early, perhaps attending industry events or connecting with professionals on platforms like LinkedIn. And of course, planning ahead and setting clear goals will definitely help you along the way!
You said:
“And how can I stay motivated if I'm not sure about my goals yet?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s totally understandable! One way is to break your goals into smaller, manageable steps and celebrate each milestone. Also, staying curious and open to new experiences can keep you motivated. It’s helpful to remind yourself of the bigger picture and stay flexible, adjusting your path as you learn more. And of course, seeking support from mentors or peers can really help keep you inspired.
You said:
“Okay, thank you for your time. I will think about it.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! Take your time, and if you have any more questions down the line, just let me know. Best of luck, and I’m here whenever you need!








Task 2: Participating in Group Decisions and Negotiating
Responsibilities

You said:
“All right, now we have a new topic about the practical planning in group discussions and negotiation responsibility. You and me are a part of a team working on a group project. I need to share my opinion politely and negotiate rules. We need to practice how to discuss in a more polite way. Now we will start and I will say something and you have to answer me.”
00:48
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds great! I’m ready whenever you are. Just go ahead and share your thoughts, and I’ll respond in a polite and constructive way. Let’s get started!
You said:
“Hi, we have just started our group project. Can we print the text together?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! That sounds like a great idea. We can definitely collaborate on the text. Do you have any specific sections or ideas in mind that you’d like to start with?
You said:
“Before that, I think we should set our daylights today. Can we agree on who does what?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s a great plan. Let’s definitely set some clear guidelines for who will handle each part. How would you like to divide the tasks, or do you have any preferences on roles?
You said:
“Maybe we have to setting the topic.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds perfect! We can start by brainstorming the main topics and then decide who will focus on which area. Sound good? Let’s get those topics laid out first!
You said:
“Okay, and I think we should present first so we have more time to write. I see your point, but I'm worried about the time.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a really good point! We can definitely prioritize the presentation first to ensure we have enough time. Let’s map out what we need for that and then we can fill in the details afterward. Sound good to you?
You said:
“Okay, and who wants to do the writing part?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! We can definitely discuss that and see who’s comfortable with which sections. Maybe we can each volunteer for the parts that match our strengths. How does that sound to you?
You said:
“Yeah, it sounds good. And should I take a note when everyone is talking and I'm recording all the parts of our text?”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that would be really helpful! Taking notes and recording the key points will keep everything organized and ensure we don’t miss anything important. Let’s definitely do that as we go along!
You said:
“And so now our timeline, maybe we're setting up on this Friday 8 p.m., will it be okay?”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds like a perfect plan! Friday at 8 p.m. works well for me. We can make sure everything is prepared by then. Looking forward to it!
You said:
“Let's message each other if we run into the problems. Will it be OK?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a great idea! We’ll definitely keep in touch and support each other along the way. If any issues come up, we’ll sort them out together. Sounds like a plan!
You said:
“And if we have the different fields, can we find the middle option?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can definitely find some common ground. We can look for areas where our different perspectives overlap and create a balanced approach. I’m sure we’ll find a middle ground that works well for everyone!
You said:
“Okay, and if you can meet the deadline, what should we handle that? How?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great question! If we do run into scheduling conflicts, we can definitely coordinate and perhaps adjust our timelines a bit, or even communicate via messages or emails. We can also consider dividing tasks differently if needed. We’ll just keep open communication and work it out together!
You said:
“And how do we make sure everyone is at the same loading?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great point! We can set up regular check-ins, like brief meetings or updates, and use a shared document or platform where everyone can see progress and contribute. That way, we’ll all stay on the same page and keep each other accountable.
You said:
“Should we find the other terms for next Monday to discuss with our teacher?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a great idea! We can definitely look at everyone’s availability for next Monday and find a time that works for all of us. Once we have that, we can confirm with the teacher and make sure everything’s set. Let’s coordinate that together!
You said:
“Yeah, perfect. I'm happy to work with you. Thank you.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
I’m happy to work with you too! Thanks so much, and I’m looking forward to our collaboration. If anything comes up, just let me know. Let’s make this project a success!






Task 3: Responding to Feedback or a Performance Review
“Hi, today we are going to practice about the responsibility or feedback of performance reviews.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds great! We can definitely dive into that. Would you like to start by practicing giving feedback or receiving feedback? Let me know what you have in mind, and we can jump right in!
You said:
“Okay, now we are going to tell you a rules like we will apprentice in a feedback sessions with a teacher, manager, or supervisor. You need to listen activity, ask question, responsible, carefully, and we need to practice. And you will need to define two chatbots with you as a supervisor, teacher, or manager. You can choose a situation from the example below. Beginning with a best responsible and general try to more complex by asking about the development goals. Like now we are going to, I was going to ask you a question like, hi dear, training just finished. Could you tell me what I did well today and what I should work on next?”
01:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a great plan! We can definitely practice that kind of scenario. So, I'll take on the role of a supervisor, and I'll give you feedback on your performance. Then, you can respond and ask follow-up questions, and we can build from there. So, whenever you're ready, we can get started with a practice scenario!
You said:
“Okay. Hi. I just finished my training. Could you tell me what I did well today and what should I work on next?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! You did really well with your time management and your attention to detail during the training. One area to improve would be to ask more questions to clarify any uncertainties. Overall, you did a fantastic job! Is there any specific area you’d like more detailed feedback on?
You said:
“Thanks. I want to make to check detail more carefully like my position. Now I just training finish about the supermarket front desk. And then tomorrow I'm going to the bakery station. So I want to know more detail and more about the rules.”
00:30
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that makes sense! For the bakery station, it's definitely important to focus on product details, like ingredients and presentation, and also the timing of tasks. Tomorrow, we can definitely go over those specific rules and make sure you feel confident. Is there any particular aspect of the bakery station you’re most curious about right now?
You said:
“Not really. I want to confirm once if I stay at the check desk and then sometimes they have a long queue. Should I call help or I just follow customer waiting for the line?”
00:22
English Conversational Partner said:
That's a great question! Usually, if there's a long queue and you feel overwhelmed, it’s definitely best to call for help so that you can keep the line moving smoothly. It’s important to balance customer service and efficiency, so definitely don’t hesitate to ask for assistance. Does that help clarify things a bit for you?
You said:
“Yeah, and then today they have some, they have one customer come and to ask he lose his car key. And then I just leave her phone number and the name. Then should I talk to the other staff? Be careful if someone pick up the key.”
00:24
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s definitely something you should communicate to your team. It’s important to let everyone know about the lost item and the customer’s contact details, so that everyone stays alert and can help out if the keys are found. Good communication is key in situations like that! Let me know if you have any other questions.
You said:
“And tomorrow we will check the bakery, should I do something, homework at home or I just be relax and come to, come in the bakery station tomorrow.”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
A bit of preparation can definitely help, like reviewing some basic bakery products or the station’s layout, just to get comfortable. But it’s also totally fine to relax and come in ready to learn tomorrow. So whatever you prefer, we can definitely adapt. Just let me know what feels best for you!
You said:
“No, and I want to ask how long for the new people training, like all stations, including fish, meat, and milk, four things.”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! Usually, the training for each station can vary, but on average, it might take about a week or so to get comfortable with the basics. Some stations, like the fish or the dairy sections, might need a bit more time and practice. But we can definitely tailor it to your pace and make sure you feel confident. Let me know if you have any other specific concerns!
You said:
“And should we have a training for the sharp machine, like the meat?”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, training for equipment like the sharp machines or mixers is definitely important. Typically, you'll get hands-on training to ensure you know how to use them safely and effectively. So, we’ll definitely cover that during your training as well. If you have any concerns or specific questions about them, just let me know!
You said:
“Okay, cool. Yeah, thank you and When okay, yeah, I understand and I will try to do my best. Thank you”
00:12

“Oh, yeah. Today, I need to go to find the HR. So how can I go? And can I leave your phone number if I have a, like, if I want to, if I'm sick and I want to take a break, can I call you?”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! You can absolutely reach out if you have any questions or need to let us know about taking a break or anything like that. And for the HR office, I can definitely give you directions or help you find it. Just let me know what you need, and I’m happy to help!
You said:
“okay yeah and i also have a question sometimes the customer ask me question and i cannot explain very clearly so can what can i do”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s totally understandable! One helpful approach is to take a moment to pause and gather your thoughts before responding. You can also use simple, clear language and don’t hesitate to let the customer know you’ll find the answer if you’re not sure. With practice, it’ll get easier. And I’m always here to support you along the way!
You said:
“Okay, should I practice more in the Fundex area?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, practicing in the front desk area can be really beneficial. The more you familiarize yourself with the typical questions and processes, the more confident you’ll become. So definitely feel free to get some extra practice, and I’m here to help you every step of the way!
You said:
“Do you have any recommendation I focus on improve next?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! One great area to focus on next is building your product knowledge, so you can confidently answer customer questions. Also, focusing on communication skills and staying calm under pressure can really help. And of course, if you ever need specific guidance, I’m always here to help you out!
You said:
“Okay, yeah, yeah. And the quiz. Schedule a follow-up meeting in a few weeks to review the projects.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds like a great idea! We can definitely set up a follow-up meeting in a few weeks to review your progress and see how everything is going. Just let me know what time works best for you, and we’ll make it happen.
