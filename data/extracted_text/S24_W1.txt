Task 1: Coffee at a café in Australia
Hey there! How’s it going? What can I get started for you today — coffee, smoothie, or maybe something to eat first?
You said:
“So, could you hear me?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I can hear you just fine! So no worries there. Now let’s sort out your coffee first—what type of coffee are you in the mood for, and do you have a preference on size or maybe milk? Let me know, and we’ll get it going.
You said:
“OK, yes, I would like to taste your best coffee. Which kind of coffee do you recommend to me?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! I'd say you can't go wrong with a flat white—that's a bit of a classic around here. So, how about we start with that? And do you want it with regular milk, or are you after something like oat or almond milk instead? Let me know what suits you.
You said:
“First, I want to know if the flat coffee you say...”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Yeah, gotcha! You're asking about the flat white. It's basically a smooth espresso with velvety steamed milk, so it's nice and creamy but not too frothy. Now, just let me know if that sounds good and what milk you’d like with it, and we’ll sort it out. How’s that sound?

English Conversational Partner said:
Alright, flat white it is! We’ll get that going. Now, just to check, would you like to stick with regular milk or go for something like almond or oat milk? And once we’ve got that sorted, are you thinking about grabbing a bite as well—maybe a pastry or a bit of brekkie on the side? Let me know what you’re in the mood for.
You said:
“Okay. Sorry, sorry. I want to know if the flat white has a lot of milk because I don't like a lot of milk. I prefer a little milk.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! A flat white does have a bit of milk, but it’s not super milky like a latte. It’s kind of in-between, with just a nice layer of steamed milk. If you want even less milk, we can do a smaller size or even a long black with just a splash. Now, let me know what you reckon and if you’re keen on anything to eat alongside your coffee. What's your pick?
You said:
“Yes.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! We'll keep it nice and simple. I’ll make that flat white with just a bit of milk for you. Now, on the food side, we've got some pretty tasty pastries and a few brekkie options. Maybe a croissant or a banana bread to go with it? Or if you’re feeling like something more, just let me know what you’re hungry for. What do you think you'd like to munch on?
You said:
“Sorry, I interrupted you.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
All good, no worries at all! We’re just having a chat. So yeah, feel free to jump in anytime. Now, let’s see about that food. Anything catching your eye, like a croissant or maybe something else for brekkie? Just let me know what sounds good to you.
You said:
“I would like to continue to know about the flat white. Is the cap big or is it a medium size?”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! So a flat white is usually in a medium-sized cup, not too big and not too tiny, just a nice balanced size. Now that you know that, how about we lock that in and maybe pick a little treat to go with it? We've got a few fresh pastries or even some avo toast if you’re feeling a bit fancy. What do you think?
You said:
“Avocado toast is the better option. Do you know if the bread is gluten-free?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can do that! Yeah, we actually have a gluten-free bread option for the avo toast, so that’s no problem at all. I’ll note that down for you. And just to keep it all smooth, would you like this to be dine-in or are you more in a takeaway kind of mood today? Let me know what works best.
You said:
“No, I like to be here to take the coffee and the apple toast.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, happy to have you stay! We’ll get you all set up to enjoy it right here. And just so you know, it’s a pretty nice day out there in Burleigh Heads, so you’ve picked a good spot to relax. Now, is there anything else you’re curious about, or are we all good to get that flat white and avo toast going for you? Let me know if you’ve got any more questions.
You said:
“OK, sorry, do you give me a table or can I select the table on my own?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing, no worries at all! You can absolutely pick your own table—just find a spot you like, and we’ll bring everything over to you. And hey, if you need any suggestions on a comfy corner, just shout out. Otherwise, go ahead and grab a seat, and we’ll have that flat white and avo toast out to you in a jiffy. Anything else on your mind?
You said:
“Yes, I would like to ask you if you have a brownie, chocolate brownie.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we do have a nice chocolate brownie on the menu, and it's definitely a hit if you've got a sweet tooth. So if you'd like to add that on, just say the word and we'll pop it in with your order. Otherwise, just let me know if there's anything else you're curious about before we get everything started for you. What do you reckon?
You said:
“Yes.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
All right, brownie coming right up as well! So we’ve got your flat white, the avo toast on gluten-free bread, and a chocolate brownie to top it off. Sounds like a treat. Now you just go ahead, pick a spot you like, and we’ll bring it all out to you. And if you think of anything else or have more questions, just give me a shout. All good?
You said:
“Yes, yes, the brownie is on the sign. It's not on the, it's not on the abacus, right?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, absolutely! No worries, the brownie’s definitely on the side, not on top of your avo toast. We keep those treats separate. So, you’re all set—just pick your table, and we’ll bring everything out the way you like it. Anything else you’re wondering about before we get everything going for you? Let me know.
You said:
“OK, yes, I would like to ask you if the brownies have nuts.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! Yep, our brownie does have a few nuts in it, just to give it that extra bit of crunch. So if that works for you, we’ll keep it as is. And if you need anything else adjusted, just let me know. Otherwise, we’ll get everything rolling and you can settle in. Any other questions on your mind? Let me know.
You said:
“Yes, yes, I want to know if the flat white is hot because I like it when the coffee is hot, not warm. I prefer that the coffee be hot.”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we’ll make sure your flat white is nice and hot for you, no lukewarm coffee here! We’ll steam the milk a bit extra so it’s just how you like it. All right, I think we’ve got everything covered then. Feel free to settle in at any table you like, and we’ll have your hot coffee and everything else out shortly. Anything else at all, or are we good to go?
You said:
“Do you have internet in this cafe? Because I need to work in the meantime that I wait for the order.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
For sure, we've got Wi-Fi here, no worries at all. You can just connect to our café network and get some work done while you wait. All right, I think you're all set now: hot flat white, avo toast, brownie on the side, and Wi-Fi to keep you busy. If there's anything else you need, just give us a shout. Otherwise, enjoy and we'll have everything out to you in a bit. Thanks heaps!
You said:
“Could you give me the password because I need to use the internet in the meantime that I wait for the order?”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, the Wi-Fi password is just up on that board over there, or I can tell you—it's "coffee123". So go ahead and log in and you’ll be all set. Now you can get comfy, and we’ll have your order out soon. If there's anything else at all, just let me know. All good?
You said:
“Sorry, coffee with double F.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
That's right, exactly—"coffee" with a double F, so c-o-f-f-e-e-1-2-3. You’ve got it. Just pop that in and you should be online in no time. And with that sorted, I think we’re all set. If you need anything else, just give me a wave. Enjoy!
You said:
“Could you spell the word?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! I'll spell it out for you: it's c-o-f-f-e-e-1-2-3. Just type that in and you’ll be good to go. And if there's anything else, feel free to ask. We’ve got you covered.
You said:
“Could you repeat, please? The spelling may be slow because English is not my first language.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, no worries at all. I'll go slow: it's c... o... f... f... e... e... one... two... three. Take your time with it. And if you need anything else, just let me know. We’re here to help!
You said:
“I try to connect my device and I wait for you with the order.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Sounds great! You go ahead and get connected, and we’ll get your order all sorted and bring it over to you soon. Just relax and enjoy the vibe, and if you need anything else at all, just give me a shout. Thanks heaps and we’ll have everything out in a jiffy.

Task 2: Booking a Restaurant Table
Hey there! Great to have you. So let's get you sorted out with a table. First up, what date and time are you thinking of, and how many people will be joining you? Let's start there. Let me know!
You said:
“I'm talking with the restaurant Ocean Coast.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, you've got it! We're right here by the ocean, so you’ll get a nice coastal vibe. Now, let's nail down the details. What date and time would suit you, and how many guests are we looking at? Just let me know and we’ll take it from there.
You said:
“OK, I would like to book a table for tomorrow night at 6 o'clock.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
All right, tomorrow at six o'clock sounds perfect. And how many people should I put that booking down for? And we can chat about seating options too, like if you'd prefer indoor, outdoor, or maybe a nice window seat. Just let me know what you have in mind!
You said:
“I have a mind to sit outdoors, but if I prefer, I don't know, I didn't know the place. Is the place comfortable to be outdoors?”
00:15
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, it's pretty comfy outside. We’ve got a nice outdoor area with a bit of a breeze and a view of the coast, so it's a great spot if the weather's good. And if you decide you'd rather be indoors, just let us know and we can sort that out too. Now, just to confirm, how many people should I set this up for, and is there any special occasion we should know about? Let me know!
You said:
“Yes, I have one more question about the place. I understand that you told me that if, in the moment when we are there, you need to move indoors, we can.”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, you can definitely switch to indoors if you need to. We’re pretty flexible, so if the weather changes or you just feel like a cozier spot inside, just let us know and we’ll sort it out on the spot. Now, just to circle back, how many people should I book for, and is it for any special occasion like a birthday or anniversary? Let me know!
You said:
“OK.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! So just let me know the number of guests and if there’s any special occasion we should be aware of. We love to add a little extra touch if it’s a celebration. And of course, if you’ve got any dietary preferences or anything else you’re curious about, just ask away. What’s next on your mind?
You said:
“Sorry, what's... what?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, no worries at all! I was just saying feel free to let me know how many guests you’re booking for and if there's any special occasion we should know about. We like to add a nice touch for celebrations. And of course, if you have any dietary needs or questions about the menu, just ask. So what details would you like to share next? Let me know!
You said:
“Okay, okay, yes, it's my birthday, we will be ten people, ten people, sorry, one of them is a baby, two, with two babies, and we need a special chair for a baby, I suppose that you have this kind of chair.”
00:30
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that's fantastic! Happy early birthday! We'll set it up for ten people, and of course, we've got high chairs for the little ones, so that’s no problem at all. We’ll make sure you’re all comfy. And since it's your birthday, we'll add a little special touch to make it a bit more festive. Now, if you have any dietary preferences or if there's anything else you'd like to know about our menu or the vibe, just let me know. What else can I help you with? Thanks for sharing that!
You said:
“Thank you.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
You're very welcome! We'll make sure everything's all set for your birthday gathering. And of course, if you think of anything else or have any more questions, just let me know anytime. We’re looking forward to having you all here. Thanks again for booking with us! If there's anything else on your mind, just ask.
You said:
“No, no, no, no, no, please wait, wait, because I want to explain you which kind of food we order, we will order. Tell me about the menu, which is the, what are the options?”
00:21
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing, absolutely! No rush at all. So our menu has a good mix of fresh seafood, some great steaks, and plenty of veggie options as well. We’ve got a few local favourites like our grilled barramundi and a nice slow-cooked lamb. And if anyone’s got any dietary needs, just let us know and we can tweak things as needed. So feel free to tell me what you and your guests are in the mood for, and we’ll go from there! What kind of dishes are you thinking about? Let me know.
You said:
“Well, I would like to order seafood, maybe it could be sushi food for the entrance, and then I would like to order salmon with vegetables. I like the fresh vegetables, I prefer fresh vegetables than the cooked vegetables. It is possible.”
00:33
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can do that for sure. We've got some nice seafood starters we can adapt into a sushi-style entrée, no problem at all. And we can definitely do a salmon main with fresh veggies on the side instead of cooked ones. So we’ll get that all noted down for your group. If you've got any other special requests or details, just let me know, and we'll make it happen. Anything else on your mind?
You said:
“Yes, I suppose that part of the group prefers something with meat. Well, which are your options?”
00:15
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! We've got some great meat options as well. Our slow-cooked lamb is pretty popular, and we also do a nice steak with a choice of sides. So there's definitely something for everyone. Just let us know who wants what on the night, and we'll take care of it. And of course, if there's anything else you think of, just shout out. Anything else you're curious about? Let me know!
You said:
“Yes, I am thinking about the drinks because someone prefer cocktail or some others prefer something with alcohol. Not for me because I prefer water, but I know that, for example, my husband prefer a beer or white wine. Which kind of brands have you in the restaurant?”
00:39
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we've got you covered. We've got a pretty nice selection of cocktails and a good range of beers and wines, including some local Aussie brands. So your husband can definitely grab a beer or a white wine, and we've got plenty of options. And of course, we’ll have water for you, no worries at all. If you need any other details, just let me know!
You said:
“Yes, I want to know if people can order in the moment. Obviously, in between the options that you give me, they don't order anything off the menu, but they can order, they will order everything that you offer on the menu, of course.”
00:39
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that's no problem at all. Everyone can just order from the menu on the night, so they can choose whatever they fancy from the options we have. And we’ll just make sure everyone’s got something they like. So yeah, they can absolutely order on the spot from the menu, no worries at all. If there’s anything else, just let me know!
You said:
“Yes, could you ask about the dessert?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
For sure! We've got a nice dessert selection as well, things like a classic pavlova, a rich chocolate fondant, and even some lighter fruit sorbets if you prefer. So there’s a bit of something for every sweet tooth. Just let me know if any of those sound good or if you’ve got any other dessert questions.
You said:
“You mentioned something about chocolate, would you like to explain me more about this kind of dessert?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! So our chocolate dessert is a warm chocolate fondant. It's got a gooey center, and it's served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on the side. It's definitely a favourite if you're into chocolate. So if that sounds like something you'd enjoy, just let me know, and we can definitely add it in. Anything else you're curious about?
You said:
“Yes, do you know if in this dessert I will put, I can put, can put a candle or something like that to celebrate my birthday?”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can do that for you, no worries at all! We’ll pop a little candle on your chocolate fondant to make it a proper birthday treat. It’s a nice way to celebrate, and we’re more than happy to do it. So consider it done. And if there’s anything else you’d like to add or ask, just let me know. We're here to help make it special! Thanks for sharing that.
You said:
“How can I say in English, in Australian English, when someone puts the candles in the cake and blows out the fire? How can I say?”
00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Yeah, for sure! In Aussie English, you’d just say something like, “We’ll pop a candle on the cake and you can blow it out when you’re ready.” It’s pretty casual. So that’s how you’d put it. And if you’ve got any other language questions or anything else, just let me know. Thanks for asking!
You said:
Oh, that’s interesting! Can you show me how I could say that?
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! So you’d say, “We’ll pop a candle on the cake and you can blow it out when you’re ready.” I’ll spell that out for you: “We’ll pop a candle on the cake and you can blow it out when you’re ready.” Hope that helps, and feel free to ask if you need anything else!
You said:
“Poppy candle is the term when you say that you blow out the fire.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Yeah, that's right! When we say "pop a candle on," we just mean we’ll put a candle on top for you. And then when you blow it out, that's just how we say you’ll blow out the flame. So it’s all nice and simple. If that all makes sense, that’s great, and if you’ve got any more questions, just let me know!
You said:
“Yes, I would like to give a present to the people when the dinner finishes. Could you suggest some presents that I can give them when the celebration dinner finishes?”
00:25
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a lovely idea. You could go with something small and local, maybe little jars of local honey or some artisanal chocolates. It’s a nice little takeaway gift. We can definitely help arrange that for you if you'd like. Just let us know what you’re thinking and we’ll help make it happen. Anything else on your mind?
You said:
“Yes, I love the idea. I like the chocolate, a box of chocolate for each member of my family. Well, I booked this table for 10 people for tomorrow at 6 o'clock in your restaurant. It's okay? Something else?”
00:26
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s all perfect. We’ll have those little chocolate boxes ready for your family as a nice takeaway gift. And your table for ten tomorrow at six is all booked in. If you think of anything else, just let us know. Otherwise, we’ll see you then and we’ll make sure you have a fantastic birthday celebration. Thanks so much!
You said:
“Thank you, cheers!”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Cheers! You're very welcome. We’ll see you tomorrow and make sure everything goes smoothly. Looking forward to it!
You said:
“Perfect. Thank you. I appreciate your time.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, my pleasure! We’re really happy to help, and we'll make sure you have a great time. Thanks for chatting and we’ll see you then!
You said:
“Bye!”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Bye! Thanks again and have a wonderful day. We'll see you soon!
You said:
“See you soon. See you tomorrow.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
See you tomorrow indeed! Looking forward to it. Take care until then!
