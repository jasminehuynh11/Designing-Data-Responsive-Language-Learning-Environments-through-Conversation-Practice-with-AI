I'm glad to hear that! If there's anything specific you'd like to practice or any scenario you'd like to roleplay, just let me know!
You said:
I want to practice visiting a medical clinic in person to make, change, or cancel an appointment. You are a recession list or staff member at the medical clinic. I will play the role of the patient. Please create a realistic store scenario and respond as if we were really there. Let's start with a simple booking and try a more detailed interaction by asking about checkup procedures, pre-inscription requirements, or clinic policies.
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds great! Let's get started
English Conversational Partner said:
Receptionist: Good morning! Welcome to our clinic. How can I assist you today? Are you here to book an appointment, or do you need to make a change to an existing one?
You said:
Hi, morning. I want to book an appointment to see doctor. Is it available today?
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! Let me check our schedule for you. May I know which doctor you’d like to see, and what time works best for you today?
You said:
I think afternoon is fine for me.
English Conversational Partner said:
Alright, that works! Let me see what slots we have available this afternoon. Could you also let me know the reason for your visit, so I can match you with the right doctor?
You said:
I've had a fever and cough for a few days.
English Conversational Partner said:
I'm sorry to hear that. I'll definitely make sure we get you the right doctor. Let me quickly check the available slots for this afternoon. Could you also provide me your full name and contact number, just to confirm the appointment details?

English Conversational Partner said:
Thank you, Eun Jung Yoo! I’ve got that noted. Now, let me just confirm the available time slots for this afternoon, and I’ll let you know which one we can book for you. Just give me a moment.

You said:
Can I receive my prescription for work?
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it! I'll make a note that you'd like a prescription refill during your visit. If there's anything specific you need or any other questions, just let me know. Otherwise, we'll see you at 4:00 PM!
You said:
Thanks, that really helped.
English Conversational Partner said:
You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you need anything else, just let me know. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you this afternoon.
You said:
Bye for now!
English Conversational Partner said:
Bye for now! Have a great day, and I'll see you soon.
You said:
Okay, let's change the topic, like cancelling appointment. How about that?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can do that! So, let’s imagine you’ve got an appointment scheduled, and you need to cancel it. Whenever you’re ready, just let me know, and I’ll respond as the receptionist to help you with that.
You said:
Hi, I want to cancel my appointment today. Is it okay?
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I can help with that. May I have your name and the time of your appointment, so I can locate it in our system and cancel it for you?
You said:
My name is Eunjung Yoo, and I have an appointment today at 4pm.
English Conversational Partner said:
Thank you, Eun Jung Yoo. I’ve found your appointment for 4:00 PM today. I’ll go ahead and cancel it for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with, or would you like to reschedule for another time?
You said:
Actually, I want to book a general checkup. Is that okay?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s no problem at all! Let’s get you scheduled for a general check-up. Could you let me know what day and time would be most convenient for you?
You said:
I think next Monday is fine for me. Is it available?
English Conversational Partner said:
Let me check our schedule for next Monday. We usually have plenty of slots available. Could you let me know what time in the afternoon or morning would suit you best?
You said:
I think morning is the best.
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! I’ll look for available morning slots on Monday. Once I find a suitable time, I’ll confirm it with you. Just give me a moment, and I’ll get that arranged.
You said:
Okay, good. Do I need to bring my Medicare card?
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, it’s definitely helpful to bring your Medicare card so we can update your records. If you have any other relevant documents or previous medical history, that can also be useful. But if you have any questions, just let me know!
You said:
How about the blood test? Will I need a blood test for this type of checkup?
English Conversational Partner said:
It depends on the type of check-up and your health history, but typically, we might do a blood test to check things like cholesterol or blood sugar levels. We can definitely discuss that more during your appointment, and the doctor will let you know what’s needed. If you have any specific concerns, just let me know!
You said:
I see. And I have a question. Do you offer translators or language support for appointments?
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely! We do offer language support and can arrange for translators if needed. Just let us know in advance what language assistance you require, and we’ll make sure everything is arranged for your appointment.
You said:
I appreciate your time. Thank you so much.
English Conversational Partner said:
You're very welcome! It’s my pleasure to help. If you have any more questions or need anything else, just let me know. Otherwise, have a wonderful day!

Week 2 – Task 2: 
You said:
Hey.
English Conversational Partner said:
Hey there! How's it going? What can I help you with today?
You said:
I want to practice visiting a local bank branch to request help with everyday banking services. You are a bank staff or customer service officer. I will play the role of the customer. Please create a realistic bank scenario and respond as if we were really there. Please start with a simple booking and try a more detailed interaction by asking about documents, accounts, futures, or banking procedures.
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds great! Alright, let's set the scene: You walk into the bank, and I'm at the front desk ready to assist you. So, let me start off:
"Good morning! Welcome to our bank. How can I assist you today?"
You said:
Hi, how are you? I just want to open a joint account with my partner. Is it possible today?
English Conversational Partner said:
I'm doing well, thank you! And absolutely, we can help you with that. To get started, I'll need to know a bit more. Could you let me know if you both have valid IDs with you, and if you have any initial deposit amount in mind?
You said:
oh okay here is our ID card and i'm sorry i don't know about the initial deposit amount what does it that mean
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! The initial deposit is basically the amount of money you put into the account when you open it. It can vary depending on the type of account you want. But we can definitely help you figure that out. Do you have a particular type of account in mind, like a checking or a savings account?
You said:
Oh, we want to make a saving account for us.
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, a savings account sounds great! In that case, we’ll just need to confirm a few details, like your contact information and your address. Also, do you know if you’d like to add any beneficiaries to the account?
You said:
What kind of a beneficiary do you have?
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! A beneficiary is basically someone who would receive the funds in the account if something were to happen to you. You can add your partner or any other loved one as a beneficiary. Would you like to add your partner as the beneficiary for this account?
You said:
Oh, yes, please.
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, that makes things nice and straightforward. Alright, so we’ve got your IDs, we know it’s a savings account, and we’ll add your partner as a beneficiary. Just one last thing: do you have a preferred branch location or a specific time you’d like to schedule the appointment?
You said:
I think I can do it today. Is it okay?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, today works just fine! We can definitely get you set up. I’ll just confirm a time that’s convenient for you and make sure everything’s ready. Sound good?

You said:
I also want to make a new credit card. Do you have any recommendations for me?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can help with that as well! We have a few great options depending on what you're looking for, like low interest rates or cashback rewards. Maybe you could let me know what features are most important to you, and we can find the best match!
You said:
Oh, I think the cashback reward sounds great.
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, cashback rewards are definitely a popular choice! I’ll go ahead and recommend a few cards that offer great cashback rates on everyday purchases. We can get you all the details and find the perfect fit. Sound good?

You said:
Yeah, let's try it.
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, let’s do it!
So, to start off, welcome to the bank! How can I assist you with updating your personal details today?

You said:
I want to apply right away, please.
English Conversational Partner said:
Awesome! In that case, I'll just need a few details from you, like your full name, contact information, and some proof of income. Could you share those with me?
You said:
Oh, yeah, sure. And should I make some documents for you?
