TASK 1:
You said:
Hi, I want to study overseas in the future. Could you tell me how to prepare now?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! Studying overseas is exciting. To get started, one of the first steps is deciding on a destination. Do you have a particular country or university in mind?
You said:
I would like to go abroad to the U.K.
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, the UK is a great choice! Alright, so the next step is to look at the universities and the programs that interest you. Do you already have a field of study in mind?
You said:
No, I don’t.
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! That gives you a bit of flexibility. So, the next step would be exploring different fields that interest you. Are there any subjects that you find particularly exciting?
You said:
I'm interested in studying for education at the moment.
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s wonderful! Education is such a meaningful field. So, the next step would be to look at universities in the UK that have strong education programs. Do you need any help with that?
You said:
Yes, please.
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! I’d be happy to help. So, we can start by looking at some top universities known for education studies, and we can also talk about entry requirements and application timelines. Does that sound good to you?
You said:
I want to improve my English in education industries.
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it! Focusing on English skills for the education field is a great idea. We can work on specific vocabulary and phrases that you’ll need. Are you looking for general English practice, or more specific areas, like academic writing?
You said:
I think make a foundation would be great, so I would like to learn general English at first.
English Conversational Partner said:
Great! We can definitely build a solid foundation in general English. We’ll focus on communication skills, vocabulary, and grammar that will be useful for the education sector. So, let’s get started with some basics!
You said:
Do you have any recommendation for studying education in the UK?
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! There are quite a few renowned universities in the UK for education, like the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and UCL. If you want, we can dive into more details about any of them!
You said:
Yes, please. How different between each university?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! Each university has its own unique strengths. For example, Oxford and Cambridge are known for their long history and prestigious reputation, while UCL is known for its diverse and innovative approach. We can explore their specific programs if you’d like!
You said:
Could you explain the specific programs of Oxford?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! Oxford has a fantastic Department of Education with a wide range of programs, from master’s degrees in comparative and international education to doctoral programs focusing on educational policy. They also emphasize research and offer a vibrant academic community.
You said:
Should I do a diploma before a master's degree?
English Conversational Partner said:
It really depends on your background and the program requirements. Some master’s programs do prefer a diploma or some professional experience, but others might accept you directly. If you’d like, we can look into the specific entry criteria for the program you’re interested in.
You said:
How is the diploma different from the master's degree?
English Conversational Partner said:
A diploma is usually a shorter program and often more focused on practical skills, whereas a master’s degree is more in-depth and research-oriented. The diploma can sometimes be a good stepping stone if you want to build some foundational knowledge before diving into a master’s.
You said:
OK, and I really want to study for education, but what are some signs that a course or subject might not be the right fit for me?
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great question! Some signs might include feeling uninterested or unmotivated by the coursework, struggling with the material even after giving it a good effort, or not seeing how the subject aligns with your long-term goals. It’s always good to reflect on how you feel about the subject as you dive in.
You said:
How can I stay motivated if I'm not sure about my goals yet?
English Conversational Partner said:
Staying motivated can definitely be challenging, but one great way is to set small, manageable goals and celebrate those little achievements along the way. Also, exploring different areas within the field can help you find what excites you. And don’t forget to connect with peers or mentors for support and inspiration.
You said:
Also, what types of jobs are common for people in my degree?
English Conversational Partner said:
With a degree in education, there are quite a few career paths you can take! Common roles include teaching, educational consulting, curriculum development, and even administrative positions in schools or educational organizations. It really depends on what interests you the most!
You said:
Who else can I talk to for career or study advice at the university?
English Conversational Partner said:
At Oxford, you can reach out to academic advisors in the Department of Education, as well as career services that specialize in helping students with career planning. You can also connect with professors who have similar interests and even alumni who can share their experiences.
You said:
That’s great. Are there any new industries or roles I should consider based on my strengths?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, there are always new and emerging fields. For instance, educational technology is growing rapidly, and roles in that sector could be a great fit. Also, educational consulting, policy analysis, and even roles in online education are really on the rise. It all depends on what you’re passionate about!
You said:
Thanks for your time. I'll look into those options.
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. Feel free to reach out anytime if you have more questions. Good luck with everything, and have a great day!





TASK 2:
You said:
Hi. We have just started our group project. Can we plan the task together? Because we need to choose the presentation order. What do you think works best?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a great idea! It’s always helpful to get everyone on the same page. Maybe we can start by listing out all the tasks and then decide who’s best at what. Does that sound good to you?
You said:
Yeah,sounds great.
English Conversational Partner said:
Awesome! So let’s start by listing out the main sections of the presentation. Do you have any particular areas you feel more comfortable with?
You said:
I think we should present first, so we have more time to write.
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense! So you’ll take the first part. What about the rest of the team? Do you have any preferences on who might handle the next sections?
You said:
This part feels too difficult for me. Can I swap with someone else?
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, we can definitely do that. We can find someone whose strengths match that section better. Do you have a particular person in mind, or should we just discuss it with the group?
You said:
Let's discuss with the group.
English Conversational Partner said:
Sounds like a plan! It’s always best to get everyone’s input. So, let’s gather the team and have a quick chat about it. Anything else you’d like to cover?
You said:
I'm happy to try the presentation, but I've never done it before. Any tips?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! Just remember to keep it simple and practice a bit. Also, focusing on your key points and making eye contact will help a lot. And I’m here to help if you need any more tips!
You said:
I see your point. Does anyone have experience with this type of project we could learn from each other?
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great idea! I’m sure someone in the group has some experience. Let’s do a quick round and see who can share their insights. Sound good?
You said:
Yes, perfect! How do we make sure everyone is doing their part fairly?
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s an important question! We can set clear deadlines and have regular check-ins, maybe even a shared document so everyone can update their progress. That way, we can all stay on track and support each other.
You said:
That's great. Do you think we need a shared document to manage tasks?
English Conversational Partner said:
I think it could definitely help! It keeps everything transparent and easy to access for everyone. We can set one up and see how it goes!
You said:
Great, thank you. Can I take notes while someone else presents?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that would be really helpful! That way, we can all focus on the content and you’ll have a solid record of everything. Sounds like a plan!
You said:
Should we check in every few days to stay on track?
English Conversational Partner said:
I think that would be a great idea! A quick check-in every few days can help everyone stay accountable and address any issues early on. Let’s do that!
You said:
Let's message each other if we run into problems.
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s a perfect approach! Keeping communication open will make everything run smoothly. I’m sure you’ll all do great!
You said:
If someone can't meet the deadline, how should we handle that?
English Conversational Partner said:
It’s always good to approach it with understanding and support. We can offer help or adjust the workload if needed, and make sure everyone feels comfortable asking for extensions if necessary. It’s all about teamwork!
You said:
So we are all agree at the moment?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, it sounds like you’ve got a solid plan in place! I’m sure your project is going to go really well. If you need anything else, just let me know!
You said:
Let’s discuss again if we were in trouble.
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds like a great plan! I’m here whenever you need to chat again. Good luck with everything, and I’m sure it’s going to be a success!
You said:
Yes, we got this.
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, you definitely do! I’m cheering you on, and I know you’ll do great. Just reach out anytime you need!
You said:
Thank you for your time!
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it! Well, I’m glad we could chat, and I wish you the best with your project. Take care, and feel free to reach out anytime.


TASK 3: 
You said:
Hi, Coach. Training just finished. Could you tell me what I did well today and what I should work on next?
English Conversational Partner said:
Hey there! Great job today! I noticed your form was really solid, especially on those sprints. One thing to work on might be your breathing technique to keep your energy up. How do you feel about focusing on that next time?
You said:
Thank you so much. I want to improve my long kicks.
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it! For those long kicks, we can definitely focus on your leg strength and your flexibility. Do you have any specific areas you’d like to target for your long kicks?
You said:
I always play center back, so I need to find space behind their defenders.
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense! So we can definitely work on your awareness and positioning so that you can spot that opponent behind you more quickly. How does that sound for a next focus area?
You said:
I also want to focus on proper defensive.
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! We can definitely focus on your defensive skills and positioning to keep you more secure on the field. We’ll make sure you’re always in the right spot to defend effectively. Anything specific you want to work on within that area?
You said:
Could you give me an example of something I did this well and something I could improve?
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! So, one thing you did really well today was your anticipation of the opponent’s moves, which is awesome for defense. One area to improve on might be your footwork, just to make sure you’re staying balanced and can react quickly. How does that sound?
You said:
Do you have any recommendation of training in the gym?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! For gym training, we can focus on exercises that build your core strength and your leg muscles. Things like squats, lunges, and core stability exercises will definitely help with your overall performance. Would you like a specific routine or some more details on that?
You said:
Yes, please.
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! I can put together a simple routine for you focusing on those key areas. We’ll include some squats for your legs, planks for your core, and a few agility drills as well. I’ll get that ready for you!
You said:
How often should I go to the gym?
English Conversational Partner said:
For overall improvement, aiming for about three times a week is a great start. That way, you give your body enough time to rest and recover between sessions. And we can always adjust based on how you feel and your progress!
You said:
Sounds like a pran.
English Conversational Partner said:
Awesome! I’m glad it sounds good to you. We’ll get everything set up, and I know you’ll do great. If you have any other questions or need anything else, just let me know!
You said:
What would you recommend I focus on improving next?
English Conversational Partner said:
Well, since we’ve talked about your defensive skills and your kicking, I think the next focus could be on your overall endurance and stamina, just to keep your energy up throughout the game. Sounds like a plan?
You said:
Yes, thank you so much. Could you give me some tips for improving my stamina?
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! One great way to boost your stamina is to incorporate interval training, like alternating between high-intensity bursts and slower recovery.
