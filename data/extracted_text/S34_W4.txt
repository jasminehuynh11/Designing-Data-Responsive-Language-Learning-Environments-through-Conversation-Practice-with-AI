00:23
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, let’s dive in!
Hello and welcome! It’s great to have you here. To begin, could you tell me a bit about your current background and what sort of career goals you have in mind?
You said:
“I'm thinking about changing my career. I've worked part-time in retail, but I'd like to try something new.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense! It’s always exciting to explore new opportunities. Could you share what kind of fields or industries you’re interested in? And also, do you have any particular skills or qualifications that you’d like to leverage in this new career?
You said:
“I'm interested in teaching music, so...”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s wonderful!
You said:
“I'd like to deal with the musical instruments.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds fantastic! Teaching music can be really rewarding. Could you let me know if you have any formal qualifications in music or teaching so far? And also, are you considering working in schools, or perhaps offering private lessons?
You said:
“I don't have any qualification about it. Do you think I need more?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great question!
You said:
“Any other certificates before applying?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, having some certification can definitely strengthen your profile. It might be helpful to look into music education courses or certifications that are available. Would you like some recommendations on where to start, or do you have any specific questions about that process?
You said:
“Yes, please tell me your suggestion.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! One great starting point is to look at certifications offered by recognized music institutions or even online courses from accredited platforms. Additionally, you might consider volunteering or assisting in local schools or community centers to gain some practical experience. Let me know if you’d like more details on any specific path!
You said:
“what kind of couse”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! There
You said:
Does the college have?
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
They typically offer a range of courses, including foundational music education programs, diploma courses in music teaching, and even specialized certifications for different instruments. If you’d like, I can recommend some specific institutes or online platforms that would be a good fit. Let me know what you’re most interested in!
You said:
“I'm interested in not only musical instruments, but also I'd like to learn about sales and management.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a fantastic combination! Blending music with sales and management can open up some unique career paths, like arts administration or managing music studios. Would you like some guidance on courses that cover both areas, or are you more interested in exploring one of those fields in depth first?
You said:
“Would you recommend the suitable course for me?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! For a combination of music and management, I’d recommend looking into programs that offer music business or arts management certificates. Some universities and online platforms offer specialized courses that blend these fields. I can definitely share some specific recommendations if you’d like!
You said:
“What should I do now if I want to apply this course?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! The next step would be to research the specific programs that interest you and check their admission requirements. You can also reach out to the admissions office for more details and maybe even schedule a consultation. If you’d like, I can help you find some specific programs and guide you through the application process!
You said:
“Do you know how much is that cost?”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely! The cost can vary quite a bit depending on the institution and the program’s length. Generally, you might find courses ranging from a few hundred dollars for online certificates to a few thousand dollars for more comprehensive diploma programs. If you have a specific program in mind, I can help you look up more precise details!
You said:
“I prefer online costs than real costs because it's cheaper than it.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That makes perfect sense! Online courses can definitely be more affordable and offer a lot of flexibility. I can help you find some reputable online platforms that provide quality courses in both music and management. Just let me know if you’d like some recommendations, and we can get started!
You said:
“How many weeks should I learn, should I study this course?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That can definitely vary depending on the depth and intensity of the course. Generally, shorter online certifications might take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months, while more comprehensive diploma programs could span six months to a year. If you have a specific timeframe in mind, I can help you find the right fit!
You said:
“After I got this certificate, what types of jobs are common for people in this certificate?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! Once you earn that certificate, you could explore roles such as music coordinator, arts administrator, or even a music marketing specialist. You could also look into positions like program manager at music schools, or even roles in music retail management. It really opens up a lot of exciting opportunities!
You said:
“How do I find Armini who've taken a similar path?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great idea! One way is to connect through alumni networks at your chosen institution, as many schools have dedicated alumni groups. You can also join professional associations related to music and arts management, and even use platforms like LinkedIn to search for alumni who’ve taken similar paths. I’d be happy to help you with some tips on that!
You said:
“No, thank you at this moment.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, no worries at all! If you have any other questions down the line or need more guidance, just let me know. I’m here to help!

You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. Feel free to reach out anytime, and best of luck with everything. Have a great day!


WEEK4-TASK 2: 

You said: 
“I want to practice how to participate in group discussion and negotiating responsibilities. You are a project group member working in company Sydney.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds
You said:
“I'll point the role of a co-worker. Please create realistic company working scenario and respond as if we are really there. Keep the conversation going naturally by asking at least 3 follow-up questions.”
00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Sounds great! Let’s dive in.
So, as your coworker in our Sydney office, we’re working on that client presentation for the new marketing campaign. To start, do you have any initial ideas on the key points we should highlight in the pitch?
You said:
“We should set our deadlines today. Can we agree on who does what?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s a great idea. Let’s make sure we clarify everyone’s responsibilities. For example, which sections of the presentation would you like to take on, and what do you think about the timeline for each part?
You said:
“Okay, here are four people.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! With four
You said:
“You're under current. Please make a presentation.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it! So,
You said:
“Me and Tom.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Alright, so it sounds
You said:
“We will make a speech and take a survey for customers.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Great, that sounds like a solid plan! So, to keep everything organized, how about we set specific deadlines for each part? For example, when do you think we should have the initial draft ready, and how do we want to divide the tasks between the team members?
You said:
“I think I and Tan should finish our survey until this Friday. Then, you and Karen should finish your initial draft of presentation by Wednesday.”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds like a solid timeline! So, just to confirm, we’ll have the survey completed by Friday, and the initial draft ready by Wednesday. Does that work for you, and is there anything else we need to consider for our roles?
You said:
“I think we should survey first, so we have more time to write.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that makes sense! Starting with the survey will give us solid data to shape the presentation. So, let’s plan to check in mid-week to see how things are going. Does that sound good to you?
You said:
“So we are all agreed on the timeline.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, definitely! It looks like we're on track and have a clear plan. We’ll keep each other updated as we go along. If anything comes up or we need to adjust anything, we’ll handle it together. Sound good?
You said:
“I have no problem, but I remember you have a lot of business this week, so don't you have any problem with this timeline?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
I appreciate you considering that! I’ll definitely manage my schedule to make sure everything stays on track. If anything unexpected comes up, I’ll let you know right away. But for now, I’m confident we’ll be able to meet our deadlines. Sound good?
You said:
“Could you show me your draft of presentation on next Thursday once you and Karin finish it?”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a plan! Once we’ve got the draft ready, I’ll share it with you on Thursday so we can review it together and make any necessary adjustments. That way, we’ll be all set for the final presentation. Sound good to you?
You said:
“Yeah.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! I'm looking forward to working on this together. If anything else comes up in the meantime, just let me know. Let’s make this project a success!
You said:
“Yes, of course. Let's message each other if we run into problems.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a great approach. We’ll keep the communication open and tackle any challenges as they come. Looking forward to collaborating and making this project shine!
You said:
“Should we check every day to stay on track?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s definitely a good idea! A quick daily check-in will help us stay aligned and catch any issues early. Let’s plan to touch base briefly each day, and that way we’ll keep everything running smoothly. Sound good?
You said:
“Yeah, good. So, could you upload your data and check our survey data online? We can use the Dropbox.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I can do that! I’ll make sure to upload all the data to Dropbox, and we can review everything together. That way, we’ll have easy access and can keep everything organized. Sounds like a plan!
You said:
“I will tell you guys the password later.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds perfect! Just let us know whenever you’re ready, and we’ll be ready to go. Looking forward to collaborating and making everything run smoothly!
You said:
“Okay, good luck. See you later.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Thanks so much! Good luck to you too, and we’ll definitely stay in touch. See you later!
























I want to practice how to respond to feedback or a performance review. You are a manager working in a company in Sydney. I'll play the role of an employee. Please create a realistic workplace scenario and respond as if we are really there. Keep the conversation going naturally by asking at least three follow-up questions.”
00:23
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, let's dive in!
Manager:
Thanks for meeting with me today. Overall, your performance has been really strong, especially in your teamwork and collaboration. One area we could improve on is the timely submission of reports. How do you feel about that?
And could you share any challenges you faced that might have contributed to those delays? Also, what support or resources do you think would help you meet deadlines more effectively?
You said:
“So, let's start. Hi, we've just finished our group project. I'd appreciate your feedback on my contribution and communication.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! I’m glad to hear you're eager for feedback. Overall, your contribution to the project was really solid, and your communication was clear and effective. One area we could refine is the way we manage timelines, especially when coordinating with the team. How do you feel about that? And do you have any thoughts on how we can improve our collaboration in future projects?
You said:
“I understand. I'll try to manage the schedule more efficiently next time.”

That sounds great! I appreciate your willingness to improve. Out of curiosity, do you think there are any specific tools or strategies that might help you keep track of deadlines better? And is there any additional support or guidance that you think would be beneficial for you moving forward?
You said:
“Now, I'm considering to use Google Schedule to organize our project next time because it is very convenient to check the deadline and schedule each other online, and it's free.”
00:19
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great idea! Google Schedule can definitely help streamline our planning. I’m curious, do you think it’ll be easy for the whole team to adopt that tool? And are there any other aspects of project management you’d like to improve as well?
You said:
“I believe it's very easy to adapt to use for everyone because user UI is very simple and is definitely user-friendly tools, so I support they can use Google Schedule easy.”
00:24
English Conversational Partner said:
That makes perfect sense! It’s definitely reassuring that the tool is user-friendly. In that case, I think we’ll have a smooth transition. Is there any particular training or support you’d like to have as we get started with it? And do you have any other suggestions for improving our workflow moving forward?
You said:
“Well, let me see.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:

You said:
“I strongly recommend using Dropbox as well, because sometimes, some people forgot”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great point!
You said:
“I forgot to submit their documentation, but if they use Google Schedule and Dropbox, I can remind them easily and they can submit the document as soon as possible.”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
Exactly, that combination will definitely help keep everyone on track and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. I’m glad you brought that up! Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other tools you think could support our workflow?
You said:
“Could you give an example of something I did this well and something I could improve?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! One thing you did really well was your proactive communication with the clients; you kept them informed and maintained a positive relationship. On the other hand, one area for improvement would be to set internal milestones a bit earlier to help avoid last-minute rushes. Does that sound helpful? And do you have any specific areas you’d like more detailed feedback on?
You said:
“Thank you. I focus on improving my schedule, organize, and milestone, how to set milestone.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:

00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds great! I'll go ahead and set that up. Is there a particular day or time that works best for you? And we can definitely go over your progress and any new goals then.
You said:
“Would you mind if we have a meeting next Saturday?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Not at all, next Saturday works perfectly for me! I'll schedule it and send you the invite. If there's anything specific you'd like to cover during that meeting, just let me know.
You said:
