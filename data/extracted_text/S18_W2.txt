It’s also good to have any additional documents that show your rental history or employment details. If you need more specifics, I’m happy to help!
You said:
“Okay, so how long does it take to hear back?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
It can vary, but generally, you might hear back within a few days to a week after submitting your application. Some landlords or agencies can respond even sooner, especially if the property is in high demand. It’s always good to follow up after a few days if you haven’t heard anything. Let me know if you have any other questions!
You said:
“Okay, so do you know when a decision will be made?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Typically, the decision can be made anywhere from a couple of days to about a week after the application deadline, depending on how many applicants there are and how quickly the landlord or agent reviews everything.

You said:
“Okay, thank you. And also, I have some other questions, like I'm also interested in another apartment. Could I apply for both?”

If you have any more questions, just let me know!
You said:
“Okay, that's good to know. Are there any furnished properties available around the same price?”

For example, Rent.com.au has a studio in Potts Point for about $490 per week, and Homely.com.au lists another studio in Paddington for around $450 per week. Availability can change quickly, so it’s best to reach out directly for the latest details. Let me know if you need more info! 
You said:
“Yes, if someone else also applies, how do you choose?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
That can definitely depend on the landlord or the agent’s criteria, but generally, they’ll look at factors like your rental history, your income, references, and sometimes even your readiness to move in quickly. Some landlords might prioritize stable employment or a higher rental offer, while others might consider things like the length of the lease. It’s always a bit of a mix, and it can vary from one property to another. If you need more guidance, just let me know!
You said:
“Okay, because I don't have rental history in Australia, can I apply now and bring the documents later?”
00:09
ChatGPT said:

You can let them know your situation and offer alternative references, like an employer reference or personal references. Just keep communication open, and they’ll likely work with you. If you need help with that, I'm here!
You said:
“Okay, is that okay to email a copy of my ID?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:

And of course, it’s always good to follow up to confirm they received everything. If you have any concerns about privacy, let me know!
You said:
“Good, um, do I pay the bond before signing the lease?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Typically, the bond is paid before you move in, but often after you've signed the lease agreement. It’s usually one of the final steps before you get the keys. The bond is held by the relevant authority, like the Rental Bond Board, and it’s refundable at the end of the tenancy if everything’s in good condition. If you need more details, just let me know!
You said:
“Okay, will I receive a written tenancy agreement before payment?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Yes, absolutely! You’ll typically receive the written tenancy agreement before you make any payments. It’s important to review all the terms and conditions thoroughly before you pay the bond or the first rent. This way, you’ll know exactly what you’re agreeing to. If you have any concerns or need clarification on any part of the agreement, you can definitely ask before finalizing anything.
You said:
