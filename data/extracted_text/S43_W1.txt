WEEK 1
Task 1: Ordering at coffee shop
You said: 
“Hello, I want to practice ordering at a coffee shop. Can you be the barista and I will be the customer? I want to practice using polite but natural language.”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds fun! Alright, I’ll be the barista. Whenever you’re ready, just let me know what you’d like to order, and we’ll take it from there!
You said:
“Good morning, how are you?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Good morning! I’m doing great, thank you! How about you? What can I get started for you today?
You said:
“I'm good, thank you. I'm new here, this is my first time trying your coffee. Do you have any recommendation?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! Well, we have a classic cappuccino if you enjoy a balanced coffee with some foam, or if you like something sweeter, our vanilla latte is really popular. Do any of those sound good to you?
You said:
“The lattes sound good. May I ask what is the cappuccino that you mentioned before?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! A cappuccino is made with equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam, so it’s a bit stronger and frothier. It’s perfect if you like a rich coffee flavor. Let me know if you’d like to try that instead!
You said:
“So, what is the difference between the cappuccino and a latte?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! So, a latte has more steamed milk and just a small amount of foam, making it creamier and a bit milder in flavor. Meanwhile, a cappuccino has more foam and less milk, so it’s a bit stronger and airier. It really depends on what you prefer!
You said:
“So the cappuccino will have stronger coffee taste.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Exactly, you got it! The cappuccino definitely has a more pronounced coffee flavor because of that balance of foam and espresso. So, if you like a bolder taste, that might be the way to go!
You said:
“I can't drink too strong coffee. My heart beats so fast, especially when my stomach is empty. Maybe I will get something less strong. Coffee?”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense! In that case, a vanilla latte or maybe a caramel macchiato would be a great choice, since they’re a bit milder and sweeter. Would you like to try one of those?
You said:
“Oh yeah, that sounds great. Maybe I will try the macchiato, the caramel one.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect choice! A caramel macchiato is delicious and nicely balanced. Would you like it hot or iced today?
You said:
“Today is pretty hot, so I will get some ice, please.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, an iced caramel macchiato it is! That sounds refreshing. Anything else you’d like to add, maybe a pastry or something to go with it?
You said:
“Yes, I saw that you have some keys over there. Do you mind if I have a look?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, not at all! We do have a lovely selection of cakes. Feel free to let me know which one catches your eye, and I'll make sure to add it to your order!
You said:
“Thank you. They all look amazing. Are there any gluten-free cakes?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely! We do have a couple of gluten-free options. There's a flourless chocolate cake and also a gluten-free almond cake. Let me know if either of those sounds good to you!
You said:
“Oh the almond cakes are great. Do you have any combo with two coffees and one slice of cake?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, definitely! We do have a combo deal that includes two coffees and a slice of cake, so that works perfectly. I’ll get that all set for you! Anything else you’d like to add?
You said:
“That's perfect. I just got the message from my friend. She asked if I can get her a mocha.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I can add a mocha for your friend as well! So we’ll have the iced caramel macchiato for you, a mocha for your friend, and the almond cake. That sounds like a great order! Anything else before I finalize it?
You said:
“I have a question about the mocha. I don't know if the mocha has a very strong coffee taste as well, because my friend can drink strong coffee as well.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
I totally understand! A mocha does have espresso in it, but it’s balanced out with a good amount of steamed milk and chocolate, so it’s usually smoother and sweeter. It’s definitely less intense than a straight cappuccino. But if your friend prefers something even milder, we can definitely adjust the coffee strength. Just let me know!
You said:
“Yes, thank you. Plea justice. She can't drink strong coffee.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I’ll make sure to keep the mocha nice and mild for her, with a bit more milk and chocolate. That should be perfect! All set then. If there's anything else you need, just let me know!
You said:
“Oh, actually, sorry, do you have any almond milk? Um, she just texted me, she said she wants some almond milk in her mocha.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! We do have almond milk available, so I’ll make sure to use that for her mocha. That’ll keep it nice and gentle for her. Anything else I can do for you?
You said:
“I just had quick questions. I saw those coffee beans over there. They all smell so good. May I ask where they're from?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! We source our coffee beans from a variety of regions, but most of them come from places like Colombia and Ethiopia. They’re all specialty-grade beans, so they have really lovely, unique flavors. If you’re curious about a specific one, I’m happy to share more details!
You said:
“I think I'm good, but I used to drink a lot of coffee back home, but I stopped for a time. I just started to drink again. That's why I just want to start with something mild.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
That makes perfect sense! It’s always nice to ease back into it with something gentle. I’m sure you’ll enjoy the iced caramel macchiato and the almond cake. If you ever want to explore different flavors, I’m here to help!
You said:
“Oh yes, thank you so much. Oh no, I'm so sorry. My friend just asked me again, and this time she wants another cappuccino for her friends of hers.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! I can definitely add another cappuccino to the order for her friend. We’ll have everything sorted out. Just let me know if there’s anything else you need, and I’ll make sure it’s all perfect for you!
You said:
“Thank you so much. So can I have one caramel macchiato, one mocha with almond milk, one cappuccino, and one slice of almond cake, please.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s perfect! I’ll get all of that ready for you: one caramel macchiato, one mocha with almond milk, one cappuccino, and one slice of almond cake. Everything is set! If you need anything else, just let me know.
You said:
“Can I ask the auditors again? I'm sorry, I'm just worried that I made some mistakes.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, no problem at all! So, we have one iced caramel macchiato for you, one mocha with almond milk for your friend, one cappuccino for her other friend, and one slice of almond cake. That’s everything! If that sounds good, we’re all set.
You said:
“Yes, that sounds great. Can you make my order to take away, please?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I’ll get everything packed up for takeaway. No problem at all! Just give me a moment, and I’ll have it ready for you. Let me know if there's anything else you need in the meantime!
You said:
“Can I ask how long would it take?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! It should only take a few minutes to get everything prepared and packed up, so you’ll have it ready in about five minutes or so. If you need anything else while you wait, just let me know!
You said:
“Oh, that's cool. No problem. I will just be near the door.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Sounds great! I'll get everything ready for you, and I'll let you know as soon as it's all set. Just hang tight, and I’ll be right with you!
You said:
“Really appreciate your help. Thank you so much. Have a great day.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re so welcome! It’s my pleasure. You have a fantastic day as well, and enjoy your coffee and cake! If you need anything else, just let me know.

Task 2: Booking a restaurant table
You said: 

“want to practice making a reservation for a table at a restaurant. I want to practice using polite language.”
00:21
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I'd be
You said:
“Can you correct me if I did something wrong in my conversation?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I'll be happy to help and give you feedback as we go along. So, whenever you're ready, we can start making that reservation. Let me know the details you have in mind.
You said:
“So, you will be the receptionist, and I will be the customer. The conversation will be occurred through the phone.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, that sounds great! I'll be the receptionist, and you can go ahead and start whenever you're ready. Let's do this!
You said:
“Hello, I wonder if you have any available tables for tomorrow night?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Hello! Yes, we do have availability. Could you let me know how many people will be in your party and what time you'd like to reserve?
You said:
“I want to book a table for two people tomorrow night at 7 pm.”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Great! A table for two tomorrow at 7 PM. May I have your name, please, to complete the reservation?
You said:
“My name is Isabella.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Thank you, Isabella! I’ve got your reservation down for tomorrow at 7 PM. Is there any special request or anything else we should know?
You said:
“Can you arrange an outdoor table for us if it's possible?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I’ll make a note to request an outdoor table for you. Is there anything else you’d like to add to your reservation?
You said:
“um because it's our anniversary and so there is a lot of preparation so i just want to tell you first because i'm going to ask a lot of questions”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, congratulations on your anniversary! That’s wonderful. Absolutely, feel free to ask any questions you have, and I’ll do my best to help you out.
You said:
“Yes, so I have a list of different components that I wish that I will have during my anniversary. So the first one I want to ask, if you provide a candle on the table for us, we have to prepare it ourselves.”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can definitely arrange a candle for your table. We’ll make it nice and cozy for your anniversary. If there’s anything else special you’d like, just let me know!
You said:
“Because it's our anniversary, so I really want a quieter or a more romantic table. I don't know if you have any table like I described.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can certainly arrange a quieter and more romantic spot for you. I’ll make sure to note that as well, and we’ll do our best to create the perfect atmosphere. If there’s anything else you’d like to add, just let me know!
You said:
“As you can remember, your restaurant has a table with a very beautiful view to the mountain. I would like to ask if that table is still available for tomorrow night?”
00:15
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, absolutely! We do have that mountain-view table, and I can reserve that for you as well. That should definitely make your anniversary even more special! If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
You said:
“I want to talk about the flower and the decorations, so do I have to pay extra money for the decoration for my anniversary, or I have to prepare ourselves what kinds of decoration that you are able to provide for us?”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Great question! We do offer some complimentary flower decorations, and we also have premium options available for a small fee. I’d be happy to share more details and arrange something lovely for you. Just let me know what you prefer!
You said:
“Oh yeah, that sounds great.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! I’m glad
You said:
“I think I would like some rose flower. I think it would be very romantic. Is that available tomorrow?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can arrange some beautiful roses for you! I’ll make sure to include them in your reservation. If there’s anything else you’d like to add or any specific preferences, just let me know!
You said:
“Oh, actually, my mistake, sorry. My partner, he will finish work at 6.30pm. I think 7pm is too early for him. He may not prepare himself. Can I change to 8pm?”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, we can definitely move your reservation to 8 PM. That should give you both plenty of time. I’ll update that for you right away! If there’s anything else you need, just let me know.
You said:
“Oh, I didn't realize that the kitchen closed pretty early. Can I still order dessert if we arrive later than 8.30?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely! We do have a selection of desserts available even after the kitchen closes, so you’ll still be able to enjoy something sweet. We’ll make sure everything’s set for you!

00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, we do! Our menu is available on our website, and I can also send you a link if you'd like. Just let me know, and you can take a look at everything in advance.
You said:
“Jes, that sounds great!”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Wonderful! I’m really glad everything sounds good to you. If you have any more questions or need any further assistance, just let me know. I’m here to help!
You said:
“So as you can remember, I tried the lamb shank once at your restaurant and it was beautiful. I wonder if this is available tomorrow because as I can remember it just on the chef special on that day.”
00:15
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, I'm so glad you enjoyed the lamb shank! I'll definitely check with the kitchen and confirm if it’s available tomorrow. I’ll make sure to let you know, and we can arrange it for your special evening!
You said:
“Yes, thank you so much. It would be great if we can have the lamb shank with the wine. I like the rose wine. Are you available? Do you have it tomorrow?”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a wonderful pairing! We do have rosé wine available, and I’ll make sure that’s ready for you as well. If there’s anything else you need, just let me know!
You said:
“I'm having a look on your menu and I'm thinking about having some entree. Do you have any recommendation for the entree?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! One popular entrée is our grilled salmon, which pairs really nicely with the rosé. We also have a delicious mushroom risotto and a classic filet mignon. If any of those sound appealing, just let me know!
You said:
“Um, do you have any lighter food, like some fresh dishes, like salad for the entree?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! We have some lovely fresh salads, like a mixed greens salad with a light vinaigrette, and also a beet and goat cheese salad that’s really popular. Those would pair nicely with your wine as well. Let me know if any of those sound good to you!
You said:
“I'm sorry, I think my idea was not very compatible with the lunch line, but I think I want some Asian salad. Do you have that option?”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! We do have an Asian-inspired salad, with ingredients like sesame ginger dressing, fresh veggies, and maybe some crispy wonton strips. That would definitely complement the lamb shank nicely. Just let me know if that works for you!
You said:
“Oh yeah, that sounds great. I saw that you have some garlic bread. I wonder if I can get some cheese on top, like make it a cheesy garlic bread.”
00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can definitely do that! We can top the garlic bread with some melted cheese to make it cheesy garlic bread. That’ll be a delicious addition! If there’s anything else you’d like to customize, just let me know.
You said:
“That would be great, but the lamb shank will be my dish, but maybe my partner, he would want to have a look at some pork option. I'm having a look now, and I will tell you in one second.”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, take your time! We have a few delicious pork options as well, and whenever you're ready, just let me know what your partner prefers, and I’ll make sure everything’s set for both of you!
You said:
“Oh, I saw so many of the pork options and they all look very delicious to me. I wonder if you can give me any recommendation.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! One of our favorites is the pork tenderloin, which comes with a lovely glaze and seasonal veggies. Another great option is our pork belly, which is really tender and flavorful. I’m sure whichever you choose, it’ll be delicious! Let me know what sounds good to you.
“I think the pork belly sounds better for me because I love tender meat and flavourful dishes. So I think I will order one lamb shank. For me, the pork belly, maybe my partner will like it.”
00:22
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds like a fantastic combination! I’m sure both dishes will be delicious and perfect for your anniversary. If you need any more recommendations or have any other special requests, just let me know. I’m here to help make it all perfect!
You said:
“Yes, I just want to check again with my order to make sure that everything is all set. So I will have the cheesy garlic bread for the entree, and then I have the Asian salad, and then for the main dish we have lamb shank and pork belly.”
00:22

“Do we have any cheesecake for tomorrow?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely! We do have a delicious cheesecake available, and it’s definitely a popular choice. We can include that as your dessert as well! Just let me know if that sounds good to you, and we’ll make it happen.

And then, entree, we have Asian salad, garlic bread, main dish, we have lamb shank and pork belly, and for dessert, we have creme brulee and a cheesecake with rose wine. Can you check everything, please?”
00:32
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that all sounds perfect! Just to confirm: you have an outdoor table at 8 p.m., with an Asian salad and cheesy garlic bread as appetizers, lamb shank and pork belly for the main course, crème brûlée and cheesecake for dessert, and a lovely rosé wine to accompany it all. Everything is set and ready to go! If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
You said:
“All right, I think that's it for today. Everything sounds perfect. Really thank you for your help.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! I’m so glad everything’s set. I hope you both have a truly wonderful anniversary. If you need anything else in the future, just let me know. Have a fantastic time!

You said:
“Thank you, see ya!”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
You're welcome! See you later, and have a great day!

Task 3: Returning or exchanging clothes and asking about store policies
 
You said: 
“Hello, I want you to practice returning or exchanging clothes and asking about the store policies. In this scenario, you will play the role of the staff and I will be the client.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that sounds
You said:
“Can we stop now?”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, we can stop anytime. Just let me know if you’d like to continue or if you have any other questions.
You said:
“Hi, I bought this jean last week but it doesn't fit.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Oh, I’m sorry to
You said:
“I wonder if I can I change it for a smaller size.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can definitely help with that. Do you have your receipt with you, and would you like to exchange it for the same style in a smaller size?
You said:
“Maybe I would just want another smaller size for the same design because I really like the design and the color.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds great! We’ll make sure to get you the right size. Could you let me know which size you need exactly, and also if you’d like to try it on before finalizing the exchange?
You said:
“Yes, definitely. My waistline, usually I would have the 28, but for deep jeans, I think I would try the size 27.”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense! We can definitely check if we have a size 27 in stock for you. Would you like to head to the fitting room and try them on, or would you prefer to just exchange them right away?
You said:
“Maybe I will spend some time to try it on and see how it feels.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds perfect! Take your time, and if you need any assistance or another size, just let me know. And feel free to call me if you have any questions.
You said:
“Thank you.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
You're very welcome! Enjoy trying
You said:
“I just...”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
All right, feel free
You said:
“I just realized that the Cy27 fits my waistline, but it does not fit my thigh. It feels very, very tight, and I don't feel comfortable with the jean anymore.”
00:17
English Conversational Partner said:
I understand, comfort
You said:
“I have my receipt here. I wonder if I can have a refund.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, we can definitely look into that for you. Just let me know if you’d prefer a refund to your original payment method, and we’ll get that sorted out right away.
You said:
“But first, I want to know about your return policy.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I’d be happy to explain. Generally, we accept returns within 30 days with the receipt, and the item should be unworn and in its original condition. If you’d like more details, I’m happy to help!
You said:
“So I have a little problem with the gene, because as I can remember, I think I...”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all,
You said:
“I think a part of the tag is already torn.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
I understand.
You said:
“I don't know if it's still eligible for return or refund policy.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s totally understandable. In that case, we can definitely take a look and see what options are available. Let’s check the details, and we’ll do our best to find a solution for you.
You said:
“Yes, that's great. Thank you so much.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! Just let me know if you need anything else, and I’m here to help.
You said:
“I wonder, sorry, because last week I also bought another item, which is the same jean, which is different color from my friend. I don't know if it was given as a gift, and it's the wrong side. What is your exchange policy? Can my friend just come here without the receipt and get the refund or exchange to another item?”
00:32
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I can help with that! Typically, for gifts, we can offer an exchange or store credit even if the receipt isn’t available, as long as it’s within our return period and in new condition. Your friend can definitely come by, and we’ll make sure to take care of them.
You said:
“So can I just give her my receipt? So next time if she wants to exchange it or have a refund, she can use the receipt again.”
00:10
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely! That’s a great idea. If you provide the receipt to your friend, she can use it for the exchange or refund without any issues. Just let us know, and we’ll be happy to help her out.
You said:
“I have another question. I wonder if I can exchange the gene for something else in the same price range.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that's definitely possible! We can exchange it for any item within the same price range or even slightly adjust if needed. Just let us know what you’re interested in, and we’ll get that sorted for you!
You said:
“All that's great, I definitely will go have a look around the shop. As I have another question, I bought to my husband a coat recently, and when we get home, and after his first try,”
00:18
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, no worries
You said:
“the zip is broke and I don't think that he has something to do with it. I wonder if I can bring the coat with a broken zip to the shop to have a refund or a change to another item.”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s definitely something we can help with. If the coat is faulty, we can offer either a refund or an exchange, whichever you prefer. Just bring it in, and we’ll take care of everything for you.
You said:
“Oh, that's great.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
I’m glad to hear that! If you have any more questions or need any assistance, just let me know. I’m here to help!
You said:
“But as you say that I have to return it within 30 days”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Exactly, yes!
You said:
“Thank you.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! If you have any other questions or need any help with the process, just let me know. I’m always happy to assist!
You said:
“Yes, so I just checked and the date that I bought the coat is within 30 days, so It is eligible for your refund policy But as I can remember I bought that items on sale I don't know if you accept returns on sale items”
00:22
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s a great question! Usually, we do accept returns on sale items as well, though sometimes store credit is provided instead of a refund. But we can definitely look at the details and find the best solution for you.
You said:
“Yes, thank you. I wonder if your shop has any tailoring service, because around my area I cannot find any tailor around there, so it would be perfect if you offer such service for us.”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we do offer tailoring services in-store, and we’d be happy to assist with any adjustments you need. Just bring the item in, and our tailor will take care of it for you. Feel free to ask us anytime!
You said:
“So, um...”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
No problem at all!
You said:
“Is it a separate tailoring service or it includes in your shop service? Because I also have a lot of clothes that I need to repair but some of them I did not buy from your shop. I wonder if I can just bring all of them and get prepared and then I will pay service fee for the tailoring.”
00:27
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we do offer tailoring services for items bought elsewhere as well, and you can definitely bring in your clothes for repairs. There will be a service fee based on the alterations needed, and we’ll make sure everything’s taken care of smoothly. Feel free to bring them by anytime!
You said:
“Yes, that's great. Thank you so much. So what I'm going to do now is I will maybe have a look around to see if I can find another item within the price range with the gene that I bought. If I can't find anything, maybe I will proceed to the refund procedure. Is that okay?”
