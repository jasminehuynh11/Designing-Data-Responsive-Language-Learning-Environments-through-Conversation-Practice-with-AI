Task 1:
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! [smiling warmly as you step up to the counter] Hey there, welcome in! What can I get started for you today?

You said:
Hi, what do you recommend today?
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! Well, today our most popular drink is the caramel latte — it‘s smooth, a bit sweet, and perfect for this chilly weather. We’ve also got a new single-origin Ethiopian espresso if you like something a little bolder.

Do you usually prefer something milky, or more of a strong coffee flavor?

You said:
I like the taste of Note Peter. Can I get something I want to eat?

English Conversational Partner said:
Ah, you like nutty flavors — nice choice! In that case, I‘d recommend our hazelnut cappuccino; it’s got a rich, roasted nut taste.

For food, we‘ve got some fresh pastries — almond croissants, banana bread, and a peanut butter cookie that goes great with coffee. Would you like something sweet, or maybe something more like a light lunch?

You said:
Okay, I’ll… Can I please get a Hazelnut Cappuccino and Banana Blade? Okay. Is Banana Blade a sweet?

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! [smiling] Just to check — did you mean banana bread? It‘s a soft, sweet loaf cake, a bit like a muffin, and yes, it’s definitely sweet!

Would you like your hazelnut cappuccino hot or iced?

You said:
It’s a hot day today, so I’d like to get iced cappuccino, please. And any other do you recommend to me?

English Conversational Partner said:
Alright! An iced hazelnut cappuccino sounds perfect for a warm day. If you‘d like to try something else, our iced matcha latte is really refreshing, or you could go for a cold brew — it’s smooth and not too bitter.

Do you prefer drinks that are more sweet or less sweet?

You said:
I already got some sweets. So I like sweeter things. Please.

English Conversational Partner said:
Got it — since you‘ve already got something sweet, maybe try the cold brew. It’s smoother and less sweet, a nice balance with the banana bread.

Would you like a small or a large for your iced hazelnut cappuccino?

You said:
I like the big captino. Can you ask me a question? I don't know Code Blue. What is Code Blue?

English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! [smiling] So, cold brew isn‘t a “code blue” — it’s actually a type of coffee! It‘s made by steeping coffee grounds in cold water for many hours instead of brewing with hot water. That makes it smoother and less acidic, with a gentle flavor.

Would you like to try a small cup of cold brew along with your iced hazelnut cappuccino?

You said:
Oh, sure. Yes, please. Is there a student discount?

English Conversational Partner said:
Good question! Yes, we do offer a 10% student discount — you just need to show your student ID when you pay.

Would you like to have your drinks here, or take them to go?

You said:
Okay, I’ll hop here, and are there a seat near the window?

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! Yes, there are a couple of seats open by the window — they‘ve got a nice bit of sunlight too.

Would you like me to bring your drinks over once they‘re ready, or will you pick them up at the counter?

You said:
There are many clusterers, so I'll invite them at the counter later. How many hours do you wait here?

English Conversational Partner said:
Got it — you‘ll pick them up later, no problem! It’s a bit busy right now, but your order should be ready in about 5 to 7 minutes.

Would you like me to warm up your banana bread while you wait?

You said:
Warm up, please. By the way, what do you like the most in this shop?

English Conversational Partner said:
Nice choice — warmed banana bread smells amazing! [chuckles] Personally, I really like our flat white; it‘s smooth and creamy, and I usually have it with a slice of almond croissant.

Do you usually drink coffee every day, or just sometimes as a treat?

You said:
I can’t drink bitter taste something, so I never tried to drink coffee, but I’ll try some not bitter coffee in the near future.

English Conversational Partner said:
Ah, that makes sense! If you don‘t like bitterness, starting with something milky like a latte or a flavored cappuccino is perfect — just like the hazelnut one you ordered.

Would you like me to add a little extra milk to make it even smoother?

You said:
If you can do it, yes please. Thank you very much.

English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! I‘ll make your iced hazelnut cappuccino extra smooth with a bit more milk. It’ll be ready soon at the counter.

Thanks for coming in — enjoy your drink and the sunny window seat!

You said:
Oh, I’m sorry. Can I check what I asked you, please?

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! Here‘s what you ordered:

One large iced hazelnut cappuccino with extra milk

One slice of warm banana bread

And one small cold brew coffee

You‘ll pick everything up at the counter, and you’ll get a 10% student discount when you show your ID.

Would you like me to repeat anything or change part of your order?

You said:
I also get a large cold brew coffee, please, and it’s okay.

English Conversational Partner said:
Alright, got it — I‘ll change your cold brew to a large one instead. So now it’s:

Large iced hazelnut cappuccino (extra milk)

Warm banana bread

Large cold brew coffee

Perfect! Thanks for confirming. Would you like a receipt with your order?

You said:
Yes, please. And how much is it?

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! So your total comes to $11.70 after the student discount — that‘s:

$5.20 for the large iced hazelnut cappuccino

$3.50 for the banana bread

$3.00 for the large cold brew

Minus 10% student discount

Would you like to pay by card or cash?

You said:
Oh, it’s very reasonable. I’d like to pay by card.

English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! You can just tap your card right here on the reader. [smiles]

Alright, it‘s all set — your drinks will be ready soon at the counter. Would you like a tray to carry everything more easily?

You said:
Oh, yes, please. I’d like a tray to carry. Thank you very much. Have a good day.

English Conversational Partner said:
You‘re very welcome! [hands you the tray with a smile] Enjoy your coffee and banana bread — have a great day!

You said:
Hello. Iced hazelnut cappuccino was very good, and also the banana bread was very sweet and great. I liked the cold brew also. That was a great lunch. By the way, today, what do you recommend?

English Conversational Partner said:
Ah, welcome back! I‘m really glad you enjoyed everything last time — that makes my day. [smiling]

Today I‘d recommend our iced vanilla latte — it’s smooth, not too sweet, and goes perfectly with our blueberry muffin or chicken pesto sandwich if you‘re a bit hungry.

Are you In the mood for something more like a snack or more like a light meal today?

You said:
I’m hungry now, so do you have something like chicken pesto sandwich?

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure do! We‘ve got the chicken pesto sandwich on toasted ciabatta — it comes with melted mozzarella and fresh basil. It’s really filling.

Would you like it served hot or just cold and fresh?

You said:
I’ll try chicken pesto sandwich, but any other out there?

English Conversational Partner said:
Good choice! Besides the chicken pesto, we also have a smoked salmon bagel, a grilled veggie panini, and a turkey avocado wrap — all really popular for lunch.

Would you like something with meat, or are you thinking of trying something lighter or vegetarian today?

You said:
Oh, I really love salmon, so I tried smoked salmon bagel, please. And, as you said, I also tried iced vanilla latte, please.

English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect combo! The smoked salmon bagel and an iced vanilla latte go great together.

Would you like your bagel toasted or just as it is?

You said:
Toast, please. Have you tried the smoked salmon bagel? Is it great?

English Conversational Partner said:
Yeah, I have! [grinning] It‘s one of my favorites — the cream cheese and smoky salmon taste amazing together, especially when it’s toasted warm.

Would you like any extra toppings, like capers or sliced tomato?

You said:
What kind of toppings are there, and what’s your recommended?

English Conversational Partner said:
Good question! We‘ve got capers, red onion, sliced tomato, and a bit of lemon dill sauce as topping options.

Personally, I‘d recommend adding capers and a little lemon dill sauce — they make the flavor really fresh and balanced. Would you like to add those?

You said:
Okay, I trust you. Capers and a little lemon juice sauce, please.

English Conversational Partner said:
Nice! I‘ll add capers and a touch of lemon dill sauce to your toasted smoked salmon bagel. That’ll taste amazing.

Would you like your iced vanilla latte in a regular size or large today?

You said:
Lodge, please, and I’ll pay by card.

English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect — one large iced vanilla latte and a toasted smoked salmon bagel with capers and lemon dill sauce. You can just tap your card right here when you‘re ready.

Would you like to have it here or to go today?

You said:
Today, I’ll take away.

English Conversational Partner said:
Alright! I‘ll pack everything up for takeaway — it’ll be ready in just a few minutes.

Would you like a napkin and a straw with your order?

You said:
Yes, please. And I’ll eat it, eat them, with my friend, so two pears, please.

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! I‘ll pop in two sets of napkins and straws so you can share with your friend. That’s thoughtful of you.

Would you like me to split the sandwich in half for easier sharing?

You said:
Yes, please. And are there something else to share easily?

English Conversational Partner said:
Good idea! Yes — we‘ve got a few easy-to-share items: mini quiche bites, chocolate chip cookies, and small fruit cups. They’re perfect for two people.

Would you like to add something sweet or something savory to share?

You said:
I’d like to add something sweet.

English Conversational Partner said:
Nice choice! For sweet options, we‘ve got chocolate chip cookies, brownies, and mini blueberry muffins — all freshly baked this morning.

Would you like to try one type, or maybe a small mix of them to share?

You said:
A small mix of them to share, please. And how much is it? How much are they?

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! A small mix box with cookies, brownies, and mini muffins is $4.50.

So your total today is $14.20 — that‘s:

Smoked salmon bagel with toppings — $7.00

Large iced vanilla latte — $4.00

Sweet mix box — $4.50

Minus 10% student discount

Would you like me to put everything in one bag, or separate the sweets from the sandwich?

You said:
I don’t mind putting everything in one bag. So, please put everything in same bag.

English Conversational Partner said:
Alright! I‘ll pack everything neatly together in one bag for you — easy to carry and share. [smiles]

Your total is still $14.20 with the student discount. Once you tap your card, I‘ll get your order started.

Would you like me to include any forks or spoons for the sweets?

You said:
Some categories, please. Okay, that’s all.

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! I‘ll pop a couple of forks in the bag for you.

Thanks so much — enjoy your food and coffee with your friend, and have a lovely day!

You said:
Thank you, have a good day too!

English Conversational Partner said:
You‘re very welcome! [smiles warmly] Enjoy your lunch and see you next time!

You said:
Good morning. Today I'll have breakfast here. So, what do you recommend to me?

English Conversational Partner said:
Morning! [smiling brightly] Great way to start the day. For breakfast, I’d recommend our avocado toast with poached egg — really fresh and filling — or a ham and cheese croissant if you want something warm and buttery.

Would you like something more light and healthy, or a bit rich and warm this morning?

You said:
I can't eat too much at morning, so something more light, please.

English Conversational Partner said:
Got it — something light sounds perfect. In that case, I’d suggest the avocado toast or maybe a Greek yogurt parfait with granola and fruit. Both are fresh and not too heavy.

Would you like something to drink with your breakfast — maybe coffee, tea, or juice?

You said:
Okay, I'll buy the avocado toast. And do you have orange juice or apple juice?

English Conversational Partner said:
Nice choice! Yes, we’ve got both orange juice and apple juice, both fresh and chilled.

Would you like the orange juice or the apple juice with your avocado toast?

You said:
Which is better? What do you think?

English Conversational Partner said:
Hmm, good question! I’d go with orange juice — the citrus flavor goes really well with the creamy avocado and toast. It’s a refreshing combo.

Would you like your orange juice in a small or large cup?

You said:
Small cup, please. Okay, that's all. I'll pay by card.

English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect! One avocado toast and a small orange juice, and you’ll pay by card — sounds great.

You can tap your card right here, and I’ll bring your breakfast out in just a few minutes. Enjoy your morning!

You said:
Thank you. What did you eat for morning today?

English Conversational Partner said:
Ah, good question! [laughs softly] I just had a quick breakfast — a slice of banana bread and a cappuccino before the morning rush. Simple, but it keeps me going!

How about you — do you usually eat breakfast at home or outside?

You said:
I usually eat cereal at home, but sometimes I don't eat breakfast at all.

English Conversational Partner said:
I see — yeah, that’s pretty common, especially on busy mornings. Cereal’s quick and easy, though!

Do you prefer something sweet like cereal, or do you sometimes like savory breakfasts too?

You said:
Can I ask a question? What does the word savory mean? I'm not good at English, sorry.

English Conversational Partner said:
Of course — no need to apologize! [smiles kindly]

The word “savory” means not sweet — it describes foods that have a salty or rich flavor, like eggs, cheese, or sandwiches. For example, toast with avocado or an omelet are savory foods.

So, do you think you like sweet breakfasts like cereal and fruit, or savory ones like eggs and toast?

You said:
I always eat sweet breakfast, but truly, actually, I like savory ones.

English Conversational Partner said:
Ah, nice! So you enjoy savory food but usually end up having sweet breakfasts — that makes sense.

If you like savory things, you might really enjoy our egg and spinach toast or mini quiche next time. They’re light but flavorful.

Do you like eggs for breakfast?

You said:
Yes, I like eggs. Oh. My lunch are already done. Okay, thank you for... Thank you. Have a good day. If you are free, please tell me your morning recipe.

English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! [smiling warmly] I’d love to share my breakfast recipe sometime — it’s really simple: just toasted bread, banana slices, and a drizzle of honey on top.

Have a great day, and enjoy your lunch!


Task 2: 
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! Thanks for calling. This is Olive Garden Restaurant, how can I help you today? Are you calling to make a reservation?

You said:
I'd like to book a table for two tonight. Do you have a table available at 8pm?

English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! Let me check that for you... Yes, we do have a table available at 8 p.m. May I have your name, please?

You said:
My name is Arthur. Can we sit near the window if possible?

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, Arthur. I’ll note your request for a window seat. Could I get your phone number in case we need to contact you?

You said:
I'm sure my phone number is 123-456-789. And my friends would like to sit at a quieter table. Can you do that?

English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, Arthur — I’ll make sure it’s a quiet table by the window if possible. Just to confirm, do you have any special requests or dietary restrictions for tonight?

You said:
OK, I was thinking now. Would it be possible to separate the bill for each of us at the end?

English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, that’s no problem at all — we can split the bill for you and your friend. One last thing, Arthur: could you please tell me your arrival time, just to make sure it’s still 8 p.m.?

You said:
Yes, it's still 8pm. And we want to know about your menu. Is the menu online?

English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, it is! You can find our full menu on our website under the “Dining” section — it shows all dishes and prices. Would you like me to tell you a bit about our most popular dishes before you come?

You said:
Yes, please. My friend would like to eat french, so I want her to eat your best french dishes. What kind of dish are you confident?

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! We’re quite proud of our French-style chicken with creamy mushroom sauce, and our beef bourguignon is also a guest favorite — rich, slow-cooked, and tender. Would your friend prefer chicken or beef, do you think?

You said:
I think she prefer beef. OK, that's all. Could you confirm the time, optional requests and my name for me please?

English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! Here’s your reservation summary:
— Name: Arthur
— Date: Tonight
— Time: 8:00 p.m.
— Guests: 2 people

Everything looks perfect. We’ll see you at 8 p.m., Arthur — thank you for calling!

You said:
Thanks so much. We are looking forward to your services. See you then!

English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome, Arthur! We look forward to serving you tonight. Have a wonderful evening — see you at 8 p.m.!

You said:
-few minute later

Hi, this is Arthur. I would like to arrange my request. Could I do that?

English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, Arthur! I can help you with that. What would you like to change in your reservation?

You said:
Thanks. I confused tonight with next Friday. All of other request are supposed not to be changed. That's all, sorry for taking your time.

English Conversational Partner said:
No problem at all, Arthur! I’ve moved your reservation to next Friday at 8 p.m., keeping all your other requests the same. Thanks for letting us know — we’ll see you next Friday!



Task3:
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure! I’ll be your retail assistant today.

Hi there, welcome back! What seems to be the issue with your purchase today?

You said:
Hi, I would like to ask you if I could return or replace a bag I perchased. I purchased this nice bag for myself, but its handle was teared while using in daily life in about two weeks. Of course I have receipt here. Can I return it, or get a refund?

English Conversational Partner said:
Alright, thanks for letting me know. I’m sorry to hear about the handle — that must be frustrating. Could I please take a quick look at the bag and your receipt to check the purchase details?

You said:
Yes, please. Here is the tear. It spoil this nice bag.

English Conversational Partner said:
I see, thanks for showing me. The tear is quite clear. Do you remember if you bought it in-store or online? That helps me check which return policy applies.

You said:
OK. I remember… I perchased in September fifteenth online. If you can't refund, I want you at least replace its handle, is it OK? Please check your return policy and let me know.

English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, let me check that for you. Since you bought it online and it’s within 30 days, we can either offer a full refund or send a replacement if the item is faulty. Would you prefer to get a new bag or just have the handle repaired?

You said:
I use it for my business and it's my favorite, so please give me a new same bag. I will ask you a question. I have already taken off the tags, is it no problem?

English Conversational Partner said:
No worries — since the damage is a quality issue, the missing tags won’t be a problem. We just need the receipt, which you already have. Could I confirm your order number so I can start the replacement request for you?

You said:
Yes. My order number is 20941760.
Thank you so much for your service.

English Conversational Partner said:
You’re very welcome! I’ve noted your order number — we’ll process the replacement and email you once it’s shipped. It should arrive in about 5–7 business days.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, maybe another item or a question about care instructions for your new bag?

You said:
No, thank you. That's perfect. I will wait for the new bag arriving.

English Conversational Partner said:
Great! I’m glad we could sort that out for you. Thanks for coming in, and I hope you enjoy your new bag when it arrives. Have a lovely day!

You said:
Have a good day too!
English Conversational Partner said:
Thanks so much! Take care and see you next time!
