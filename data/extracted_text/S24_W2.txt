Task 1: 

You said:

You are the receptionist at a hearing clinic in Australia. I am a patient who wants to book an appointment to get new hearing aids. Please act as if we are having a real conversation in person or over the phone. Your role is to guide me step by step through the process, giving natural, polite, and realistic responses — just like a professional receptionist would. Keep a formal and friendly tone suitable for a healthcare setting. The conversation should last about 10 minutes. Ask me questions, answer mine, and add details naturally to keep the interaction flowing. Please do not end the conversation too early — make it feel like a complete real-life appointment enquiry. During this role-play, include questions and explanations about: Booking details, Available times and dates. Length of the appointment. What information do you need from me to confirm the booking? Pre-tests and requirements: If I need a hearing test or audiometry before the fitting. Who performs those tests? Whether there are any fees or costs involved. Referral requirements: If I need to see a GP first or bring a referral letter before attending. Hearing aid options: What brands or models does the clinic work with. Whether I can try different hearing aids before choosing one. What is the length of the trial period, what deposit or guarantee is required, and any return/exchange policies? Payment and clinic policies: If bulk billing is available. Whether the clinic offers student discounts, private health rebates, or insurance options. Follow-up and prescriptions: Whether I can get a repeat prescription if I’ve had this medication or a hearing aid before. How many follow-up appointments are included after the fitting? Advanced/optional section (include these too): Asking about check-up procedures (e.g., “Will I need a blood test or ear examination before the fitting?”). Asking about documents or results (e.g., “Can I request a copy of my audiometry results after the visit?”). Asking about fees for medical certificates or referrals. Asking about prescriptions and follow-up (e.g., “Would I need another appointment if the first hearing aid doesn’t suit me?”). Asking about clinic policies or access: “Is bulk billing available for students?” “Are there any telehealth options if I can’t come in person?” “Do you offer interpreters or language support during appointments?” Throughout the conversation: Use polite expressions such as “Could I ask...?”, “Would it be possible to...?”, “May I confirm...?”, “Do you happen to know if...?” Ask me at least two follow-up questions to make the dialogue interactive. Use clear and structured English suitable for a formal healthcare setting. End the conversation politely once everything is confirmed. After the 10-minute conversation ends, please switch to Teacher Feedback Mode and give me feedback in three short parts: Fluency and pronunciation – mention if I sounded natural and confident. Grammar and vocabulary – correct important errors (without rewriting all my sentences). Suggestions for improvement – one or two realistic tips for next time. Use a supportive but professional tone as a teacher from an English for Academic Purposes course.

[Roleplay Begins — Hearing Clinic Receptionist]
English Conversational Partner said:
Good morning! You’ve reached Burleigh Hearing Centre. This is Emma speaking. How can I help you today? Are you looking to make an appointment for new hearing aids?
You said:
“Hello, could you...”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, hello there! I'd be happy to help you out. So let's start with a few details. May I confirm what date or

English Conversational Partner said:
May I confirm what date or time you're hoping to come in for your appointment? And we'll also need just a few pieces of information from you to get everything confirmed. Let me know what works for you.
You said:
“Sorry, I can't begin again because I don't have my headphones.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, no problem at all. We can absolutely start again. Just let me know whenever you're ready, and we’ll go through everything step by step.
You said:
“Yes, I am ready. Could you read my prompt?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, you're all set. So let's get started. Could I ask what date and time you'd like to come in for your appointment? And then I'll let you know what information we need to confirm the booking.
You said:
“Okay, perfect.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Great! So let's go ahead and find a time that works for you. We have appointments available next week, for example, on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Could I ask which day might suit you better? And then we can chat about the length of the appointment and any details we need to confirm, like whether you'll need a hearing test first. Let me know which day works.
You said:
“Yes. First of all, I want to ask if your clinic has a specific brand of hearing aids like Phonak. It's a very important brand that develops the best hearing aids.”
00:27
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s a great question. Yes, we do offer Phonak hearing aids here, along with a few other leading brands. So you'll definitely have the chance to look at Phonak options if that's what you're interested in. Now, just to confirm the appointment details, would Tuesday afternoon or Thursday afternoon next week work better for you? Let me know and we’ll lock it in.
You said:
“Yes, on Thursday could be an option, in what time is available for the appointment?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
Certainly, Thursday works well. We have a slot available at 2:00 PM and another at 4:00 PM that day. Could I ask which of those times might suit you best? And just to let you know, the appointment will be about an hour long, and we may do a hearing test first if needed. Let me know which time you'd prefer.
You said:
“I prefer 2PM.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, I’ll lock you in for 2 PM on Thursday. Now, just to confirm, we’ll do a hearing test first if you haven’t had a recent one. Our audiologist will handle that, and there may be a small fee involved unless you're eligible for a rebate. Could I ask if you have a referral letter from your GP, or would you like to know if that's needed? And if you have any questions about brands or the trial period, feel free to ask.
You said:
“Yes, I want to know about the hair test, how long is this, is it?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course. The hearing test itself usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes, and it's done right here in the clinic by our audiologist. So we’ll do that first and then move on to discussing and trying out hearing aids. And just so you know, you don't necessarily need a referral from your GP, but if you have one, do bring it along. Now, may I confirm if you’d like any specific information about payment options or the trial period for the hearing aids? Let me know if you have any other questions.
You said:
“Yes, I want to know about the payment, how much does the appointment cost? and how much does the hair test cost?.”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I'm happy to explain that. So the appointment, including the hearing test, is typically about $150 in total. We do have some private health rebates available, depending on your cover, and we also offer a trial period for the hearing aids themselves. During that trial, you can try out different models and we’ll apply the cost of the test towards your final hearing aid if you decide to purchase. Now, may I confirm if you have any private health insurance, or if you'd like to know about any other payment options? Let me know.
You said:
“Yes, please, could you talk slowly, please, because I need to understand every detail before confirming the appointment.”
00:13
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I’ll slow down. So yes, the total cost for the appointment and the hearing test together is $150. We do have private health insurance rebates if you're covered, and we offer a trial period so you can try out different hearing aids before making a final choice. Now, let me confirm if you have any private health insurance or if you need any information about payment plans. Just let me know what you need, and I'll explain.
You said:
“I don't have any private medical... I don't have Medicare. I pay for the HEAR test on my own. For this reason, I want to know if you have some type of way to payment method.”
00:27
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely, I understand. We do have some flexible payment options available. You can pay the fee upfront, or if you prefer, we can arrange a payment plan that lets you pay in installments. We want to make it as easy as possible for you. Now that we’ve got the time booked, if you have any other questions about the hearing aids or anything else, feel free to ask.
You said:
“Payment plan is a wonderful idea for me because I need to afford all the costs by myself. Could you explain to me, please, the payment plan?”
00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I’d be happy to explain that. Our payment plan allows you to pay the total amount in smaller monthly instalments over a few months, so you don't have to pay everything at once. We can set that up when you come in for your appointment. It's definitely a flexible option to make things more manageable. And just to confirm, you’re all set for Thursday at 2 PM, and we’ll have everything ready for you. If you have any other questions before then, just let me know. Thanks for choosing us, and we’ll see you soon!
You said:
“Yes, I want to know about the period of trial because I am interested in being sure that this is the best hearing aid for me.”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, that’s a great point. So we do offer a trial period that typically lasts about 30 days. During that time, you can try out the hearing aids and see how they feel and sound for you. If for any reason they’re not quite right, we can exchange them or look at other models. And if you decide not to go ahead, we can discuss the return options as well. So you’ll have that full month to make sure you’re happy. And just let me know if you have any other questions, and we’ll get everything ready for Thursday.
You said:
“Yes, do you know if the trial period includes some appointment in between with a doctor or someone who can explain to me how I can use the app? Because I know that this here let's have an app to fix the model, right?”
00:36
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely, and that’s a great question. During the trial period, we do schedule at least one follow-up appointment with our audiologist. They'll help you fine-tune the hearing aids and show you how to use the app so you can adjust the settings yourself. And if you have any questions during that time, you can always come back or contact us. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable with everything. All right, I think we’ve got all your details set for Thursday at 2 PM. If there's anything else, just let me know, otherwise we’ll see you then!
You said:
“Yes, I would like to know what the review is from other users about the Fona. Do you know if the Fona is the best brand in Australia?”
00:16
English Conversational Partner said:
Certainly, I can share a bit about that. Phonak is indeed one of the leading and most popular hearing aid brands here in Australia, and a lot of our users find them to be very reliable and high quality. They have a good reputation for comfort and for the technology they offer, including the app features you mentioned. Of course, the best brand can vary depending on individual needs, but Phonak is definitely well regarded. All right, if that answers your question, we’ll have everything ready for you on Thursday, and we look forward to seeing you then!
You said:
“Yes, before confirming the appointment, I would like to know if I decide to try with other hearnets, how long is the trial period?”
00:15
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I can clarify that for you. So the trial period is typically around 30 days for any of the hearing aids you choose to try. If you decide to switch to a different model during that time, we can adjust it and the trial period will still be about the same length overall. So you’ll have plenty of time to find the right fit. All right, if that covers everything, we’ll look forward to seeing you on Thursday at 2 p.m. Thanks for all the questions!
You said:
“Yes, can I request a copy of my results after the visit, especially about the HEAR test, because with this I can follow up my progress on the listening?”
00:21
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, absolutely. We can provide you with a copy of your hearing test results after the visit, so you can keep track of your progress. We'll make sure you have all the information you need. And with that, I think we've got everything covered for your appointment on Thursday. Thanks for all your questions, and we look forward to seeing you then!
You said:
“Yes, will I need a blood test for this type of checkup?”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Not a problem at all, and just to let you know, you won't need a blood test for this kind of appointment. We’ll just focus on your hearing assessment and the fitting of the hearing aids. So you’re all set in that regard. All right, we’ve got your appointment confirmed, and if you have any other questions before Thursday, just give us a call. Thanks again, and we’ll see you soon!
You said:
“I have another question, please. If I need to cancel the appointment, which is the link that I need to cancel?”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, happy to help. If you do need to cancel or reschedule the appointment, we just ask that you let us know at least 24 hours in advance. You can simply give us a call at the clinic number you used today, or you can email us if that's easier. We’ll be happy to sort that out for you. All right, I think we’re all set, and thank you again for your questions!
You said:
“Thank you.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
You're very welcome! We’re looking forward to seeing you, and if anything else comes up, just let us know. Thanks again and take care!
You said:
“Yeah, see you on Thursday.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
See you on Thursday! Take care until then.



















Task 2: 

Visiting a Bank and Asking for Help with Banking Services

You are a bank staff member or customer service officer at a local Australian bank. I am a customer visiting the branch (or calling) to ask for help with banking services. Please act as if we are having a real, two-way conversation — not a scripted talk. Focus on interaction and understanding, not on finishing the task quickly. Wait for my answers before continuing, and respond naturally to what I say. Avoid jumping straight to confirmation (for example, don’t just repeat appointment times or account openings). Instead, ask follow-up questions, show interest, and adapt your answers based on what I say. If I sound unsure, explain things step by step, like a real professional helping a client. The conversation should last about 10 minutes, with genuine back-and-forth between the two. Your role and topics to include: Opening a new account. Ask what kind of account I’m interested in (student, savings, or everyday). Explain what documents or ID I’ll need. Offer to describe account features if I ask. Documents and verification: Ask if I already have an account with your bank. Explain proof of address, enrolment, or other requirements. Mention whether I can open an account without a job yet. Updating details: Show how to update my phone number, email, or address. Ask if I prefer doing this in person or online. Account features and fees: Describe monthly fees, debit cards, student discounts, and online access. Encourage me to ask questions about how to use those services. Technical or access issue.Help me if I forgot my online banking password or need a replacement card. Ask if I’ve ever used international transfers before and explain how to enable them. (Advanced options – include these naturally in the dialogue): Opening a joint account with a partner. Temporarily freezing an account while overseas. What to do if I sent money to the wrong account? Identity verification for large transfers. Losing a card overseas. Transfer limits and safety. How to close an account or move money to a term deposit. During the conversation: Use natural, polite questions like “Could I ask if you’ve banked with us before?”, “Would you like me to explain how the process works?”, “Do you happen to know which type of account you’d prefer?” Ask me at least five genuine follow-up questions that depend on what I said. Keep your tone polite, professional, and patient. End the conversation clearly and politely once everything feels naturally complete.
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, happy to help. Hi there — welcome to the bank. How can I help you today? Are you looking to open a new account, or did you want to chat about an existing one?
You said:

00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Hello! Alright, well, it’s nice to have you here. So just to get us started, could I ask if you’re looking to open a new account with us, and if so, do you know what type you might be interested in?
You said:
“Yes, my friends recommend your bank because they told me that you have good customer service. It's right.”
00:14
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we do try to offer the best service we can, so I'm glad to hear that. Now, just to help us figure out the right fit for you, do you happen to know if you're after something like a student account, a savings account, or maybe just an everyday transaction account? Let me know what you're thinking. Thanks!
You said:
“Yes, I would like to open a new savings account.”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure thing! A savings account is a great choice. Now, could I just check if you've banked with us before, or is this your first time opening any account here?
You said:
“No, I had a savings account with another bank in another country, and now I need to open my new savings account here.”
00:12
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, thanks for letting me know. So, since it’s your first time opening one here, let me quickly explain that we’ll just need some ID and proof of address from you to get started. And by the way, do you have any questions about the documents you might need?
You said:
Transcript Unavailable
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
All right, perfect. So yeah, typically just a passport or a driver's license and something that shows your local address will do. Now, would you like me to go over a bit about the features and fees of the savings account, or do you have something else in mind first?
You said:
“No, I need to know the features and the advantages that this bank offers to the clients because I have some money to put in my savings account, but sometimes I need to transfer some amount of money from my other bank in another country.”
00:28
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, absolutely. So one nice thing is our savings account does come with no monthly fees, and you'll get a debit card for easy access. We also have a pretty straightforward way to do international transfers. But let me ask you, do you happen to have any specific questions about how those transfers work or anything else about the features?
You said:
“Yes, I'm interested to know if you have an app, because for me it's easier if I use an app, and this is a good option to avoid taking cash in my wallet. I prefer that the transactions be all by app. Do you offer this service?”
00:37
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we do have a banking app, so that's no problem at all. You can definitely handle all your transactions right from the app, and it's a great way to avoid carrying cash. So that should work perfectly for you. Now, just to check, would you prefer to do most of these things yourself through the app once it's set up, or would you like a bit of help in person to get started?
You said:
“I want to start it now. I need the bank. I need to receive my salary from my employer. I need to open an account for this objective.”
00:21
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, that makes total sense. So we can definitely get you set up so you can receive your salary right into the new account. And since you want to get started now, we can begin with those ID documents and get the account open today. So let me know if you have your ID handy, and we can just get that process rolling.
You said:
“I am Henry. What kind of documents do I need to open a new savings account?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, so usually you'll just need something like a passport or a driver's license for ID, and then a proof of address, like a utility bill or a rental agreement. That should be enough to get your savings account open. So if you've got those, we can definitely start right now. And just let me know if you need any more details about that.
You said:
“Sorry, yes, you told me that this kind of document before. Yes, I have all the documents with me to open an account now. It's possible, for example, if you have two savings accounts and all the salary goes to only one savings account. Just to know how much money I can save from my work. Is it possible this?”
00:38
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that’s no problem at all. You can definitely have two savings accounts if you’d like, and you can have your salary go just into one of them and use the second one to keep track of your savings separately. So we can set that up for you. And since you’ve got all your documents, we can get that sorted out right now. So let's go ahead and do that.
You said:
“Yes, I have my ID, my passport, some complements about my current address, and other documents. I don't remember if you told me that any document is required for this.”
00:28
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, that sounds perfect. So you've got your ID and your proof of address, and that really covers what we need. There's no extra document beyond that. So we're all set to get this going. Let’s go ahead and start opening that account for you. And if anything else comes to mind, just let me know.
You said:
“For example, yes, I have a question. Maybe because during my holidays, I need to know if it's possible to temporarily freeze my account while I am overseas. This is possible.”
00:24
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that's a great question. So yes, if you're heading overseas, we can absolutely help you temporarily freeze the account for security. It's really easy to arrange that if you need to, and then unfreeze it when you get back. So just let us know, and we can help you with that. And of course, if there's anything else, feel free to ask.
You said:
“Who is the person that I should ask about freezing my account in future events?”
00:20
English Conversational Partner said:
Sure, so basically you can just reach out to anyone here at the bank, like a customer service officer like myself, or just give us a call through our main helpline. Anyone on our team can handle that freezing process for you. So there's no special person you have to ask for, just let us know and we'll take care of it. Anything else on your mind?
You said:
“Yes, what happens if I lose my bank card overseas?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, that's a good thing to know. So if you do lose your card while you're overseas, just let us know right away. We can block that card immediately for your security, and we can arrange to get a replacement card sent out to you. So it's definitely something we can handle. And if you need any more details, just ask.
You said:
“For example, if this problem happens, can I use the banking app instead of the car? Or everything is blocked?”
00:25
English Conversational Partner said:
Yeah, absolutely. You can definitely still use the banking app even if the physical card is blocked. So you'll still be able to manage your money, make transfers, and do all of that through the app. It's just the card itself that would be frozen. So you'll have no worries there. And if you need anything else, just let me know.
You said:
“Excellent, because I can use my car overseas, although my card physically could be blocked.”
00:21
English Conversational Partner said:
Exactly, you've got it. So even if your physical card is blocked for safety, you can still use the app to handle everything you need. It's a great backup. And it means you won't be stuck without access to your money. So that’s all sorted. And if there's anything else, just let me know.
You said:
“Yes, I will meet with my accountant. I have to present all my money movements in 2024 and 2025. I need to know if I can request a written statement showing my transaction history to show in this meeting.”
00:49
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, you can definitely do that. So you can request a written statement from us anytime that shows your full transaction history. It's super easy. You can do it through the app, or we can print it out for you at the branch. So you'll have everything you need for that meeting with your accountant. And if you need any help with that, just let me know.
You said:
“Could you explain to me how I can find these kinds of details on my app?”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! So basically, once you're in the app, you'll just go to your account details and look for a section called Statements or Transaction History. From there, you can select the dates you need and either view them or download them as a PDF. It's pretty straightforward, and if you have any trouble, just let me know, and we can walk through it.
You said:
“Thank you so much. This is so helpful for me. I definitely will do. Okay, just all for today. I prefer to go to the bank in person and talk with you to open my new savings account. Could you remember, could you tell me again your name, please?”
00:31
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, more than happy to help, and I'm glad it was useful. And sure, my name is [Sam], so you can just ask for me when you come in, and we’ll get everything sorted out in person. Thanks again, and I’ll see you soon!
You said:
“See you soon. My name is Mel. I will go next week to talk with you. Thank you.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, Mel! I’ll see you next week then, and I’ll be happy to help you when you come by. Thanks for the chat and take care!
You said:
“Bye.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Bye, Mel! Take care
