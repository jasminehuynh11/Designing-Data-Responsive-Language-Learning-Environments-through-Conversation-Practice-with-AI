00:15 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
No worries at all! I’m happy to help you practice English. So, let’s just have a casual conversation. Is there any particular topic you’d like to talk about, or any area you’d like to focus on? 
Você disse: 
“Yes, now I need to talk about doctor and medical. I don't know.” 
00:12 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
That’s perfectly fine! We can definitely chat about doctors and medical appointments. Feel free to ask me anything, and I’ll help you with vocabulary or phrases. What would you like to start with?

“So now I need practical conversation in English about doctors or appointments.”

English Conversational Partner disse: 
Absolutely, that sounds great! We can pretend that you’re making an appointment or asking about symptoms. Let’s start with something simple: maybe you can imagine that you need to schedule a check-up. How would you start that conversation?

Você disse: 
“I prefer day appointment, please.” 
00:06 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
Got it! A daytime appointment it is. And do you have a specific doctor in mind, or are you flexible with which doctor you see? 
Você disse: 
“I'm sorry, I don't understand, won't you repeat, please?” 
00:05 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
Of course! I was just asking if you have a specific doctor you’d like to see, or if you’re open to seeing any doctor. Let me know what you prefer! 
Você disse: 
“Don't specifically because I don't have nothing, it's only ChatGP.” 
00:08 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
That makes perfect sense! We can definitely arrange a general check-up. Could you let me know which day and time would be most convenient for you? 
Você disse: 
“Okay, I prefer 10 a.m. Thursday or Friday.” 
00:09 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
Perfect! So we can look at either Thursday or Friday at 10 a.m. Let me know if you have a preference between those two days, and we’ll get that scheduled! 
Você disse: 
“Those days, please.” 
00:01 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
Alright, Thursday at 10 a.m. it is! I’ll go ahead and mark that down. Is there anything else you’d like to know or anything else I can help you with regarding the appointment? 
Você disse: 
“Okay, perfect.” 
00:01 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
Awesome! I’m glad that works for you. If you need anything else, just let me know. Otherwise, we’re all set for Thursday at 10 a.m. 
Você disse: 
“Yes, of course.” 
00:01 
English Conversational Partner disse: 
Great! I'm glad we could sort that out. Feel free to reach out anytime if you have more questions. Otherwise, I’ll look forward to our chat next time. Have a wonderful day!
