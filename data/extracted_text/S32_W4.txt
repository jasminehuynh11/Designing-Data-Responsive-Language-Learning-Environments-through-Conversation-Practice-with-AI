week 4

Task 1: Discussing Study or Career Plans with an Advisor:

Prompt: “I want to practice how to discuss about studying at career plans with an advisor. You are a university advisor in Grisbane. If we play the role of a university student, please create a realistic scenario and keep going with the conversation naturally.”

AI: Absolutely, that sounds great! Let’s dive into it. 
Hi there! It's nice to see you. How are you today? What can I help you with regarding your studies and career plans?
ME: “Hi, yes, I need some help because I'm in the middle of my career, but I'm not sure if I want to continue doing or if I want to change my career, or if it's possible to have two careers in this moment, so I'm so confused.”
AI: I understand, that can definitely feel overwhelming. Let’s break it down a bit. Could you tell me a little about your current field of study and what you’re considering as a potential new career? That’ll help us figure out the best path forward.
ME: “Okay, my actual career is graphic design, and I feel I really like it. I enjoy it, but at the same time, I feel really stressed about the projects, and I feel I'm not good enough for that, and sometimes I feel like I really have a big interest in how the brain operates and the behavior of the people, so I don't know, sometimes I feel like I like to study psychology or something like that, but these two majors are so different things, so I don't know.
AI: I totally get that. It’s really common to have diverse interests. Maybe we can explore how your skills in graphic design might complement a psychology-related career, or look at ways you could combine both fields. To start, could you share what kind of projects or tasks in graphic design you find stressful, and what aspects of psychology interest you the most?
ME: “I feel I'm really stressful sometimes in graphic design with the programs, because, especially with three-dimensional models, because it's something that I like, and animation is something that I like, but at the same time it's really hard for me. I don't know, I think my classmates, they are doing very well and they progress a lot, and I know people learned in different ways, in different speeds, but I feel like I lost, I understand things, but at the same time I don't understand some topics, or I don't know how to say, but some meaning words, like basic things, so I don't know.”
AI: I completely understand that feeling. Everyone has their own pace, and it’s okay to find certain areas challenging. It’s great that you’re exploring your interests in psychology as well. Maybe we can look at some courses or resources that can help bridge that gap or make the transition smoother. Out of curiosity, do you have any specific areas of psychology that you’re drawn to, like clinical psychology or cognitive psychology?
ME: “I don't really sure, I just feel like I really like this kind of psychology things, the behavior, the mental health, and how the brain operates, so I don't know exactly now, to be honest.”
AI: That’s totally fine; it’s normal to be in that exploratory phase. We can definitely help you narrow things down over time. Perhaps we could start by looking at some introductory psychology courses or workshops and see what sparks your interest. In the meantime, do you have any thoughts on how you’d like to blend your current skills with your new interests, or are you just curious for now?

ME: “I would like to try some courses or I don't know if the university has some classes that I can take for free or a place that I can go to know if psychology appeals with me or not.”
AI: That sounds like a great plan! We do have some introductory psychology courses at the university that are either free or available at a reduced rate. I can definitely help you find those and guide you through the options. In the meantime, would you like me to look into some local workshops or online resources as well?
ME: “Yes, I would like to go on, what time is the introducing psychology classes in the university? If I really like psychology, it is possible to change my career in this point? Or if I decide to take both careers, do you recommend that I take both at the same time? Or first finish graphic design and after study psychology, what do you recommend me in this case?
AI: Absolutely, I can help with that! We do have some introductory psychology classes offered in the evenings and on weekends, so they’re quite flexible. And absolutely, it’s possible to transition or even combine both fields. We can definitely create a balanced plan that lets you finish your graphic design degree and gradually incorporate psychology. We can also explore part-time options or even overlapping courses. Let’s chat more and find a path that feels right for you!
ME: “Okay, so for now, how can enrollment in the introduction psychology classes to start?”
AI: Great! To get started, I can help you with the enrollment form and provide you with the schedule. Usually, you can register online through the university portal, and I’ll guide you step-by-step. Would you like me to send you some detailed information on the available classes and how to sign up?
ME: “Yeah, that's correct, and I would like to know, like, when I take the classes, how I know that I really want to continue doing that, or, I don't know, and I have to continue with my current career, so I don't know, like, how I know that, in this case, this is what I want to do, or not.”
AI: That’s a really good question! I think a great way is to start with some introductory courses and see how you feel after each class. You can also try some hands-on experiences, like internships or volunteering in a psychology-related field, to get a taste of it. Over time, you’ll get a clearer sense of whether it’s the right path. And of course, we can always adjust your plan as you go along. Sound good?
ME: “Okay, so yes, I want to continue with the process to start introducing class in psychology.”
AI: Perfect! I'll gather all the details for the upcoming introductory psychology classes and guide you through the enrollment process. I’ll send you all the information, and we’ll get you started on this exciting journey! If you have any more questions along the way, just let me know.
ME: “Okay, thank you. The last question that I have is how many classes I could take and after that I can come here whenever I want, like when I feel like I want to talk with you or we have sessions to have the process about what is the best for me or with options or if I decide to take both, but I don't know.”
AI: Absolutely! Typically, you can take one or two introductory classes per semester, depending on your schedule and availability. And of course, I’m always here to support you. We can schedule regular check-ins, and you’re welcome to reach out anytime you need guidance or have questions. We’ll tailor everything to suit your needs and make sure you feel confident and comfortable with your choices.
ME: “Okay, thank you. If it's possible, and it's okay, I would like to have a session with you, like, two weeks per month, for, I don't know, I don't know exactly what time.”
AI: Absolutely, that sounds great! We can definitely arrange bi-weekly sessions to check in on your progress and discuss any questions or concerns you have. We’ll find a schedule that works well for you, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Just let me know what times and days work best for you, and we’ll get it all set up!
ME: “Can I tell you by email? Because now I'm not sure if you send me the information about the introducing psychology classes. First, I want to organize my schedule with the introducing class. And after that, if it's possible, I can tell you. So it's okay.”
AI: “Can I tell you by email? Because now I'm not sure if you send me the information about the introducing psychology classes. First, I want to organize my schedule with the introducing class. And after that, if it's possible, I can tell you. So it's okay.”
ME: “Okay, thank you. I want to start step-by-step.”
AI: That sounds perfect! I'm looking forward to helping you along the way. Just reach out whenever you’re ready, and we’ll take it step-by-step. Have a great day, and I’ll be here whenever you need me!
ME: “Okay, thank you for listening to me, and see you in another day.”
AI: You’re very welcome! Absolutely, take care, and I’ll look forward to chatting again soon. Have a wonderful day!
ME: “Thank you, have a good quarantine, and bye-bye.”
AI: Thank you so much! Bye for now, and take care!

Task 2: Participating in Group Decisions and Negotiating
Responsibilities:

Prompt: “Hi, I want to practice how to participate in group decisions and negotiation responsibilities. You are a project group member and I will play the role of one of the teammates in the project group. In total, we are three members, so please carry the realistic scenario and keep going with the conversation naturally.”

AI: Absolutely, that sounds great! Alright, let's say we're working on a project about developing a new app. We’re three team members: you, me, and another teammate. So, let’s dive in!
To start, maybe you can let me know what your main idea or your perspective is on the project, and then we can go from there. Sound good?
ME: “I think for the first part, we need to select what kind of app we want to create. And when we have what kind of app, we can decide what is the target, how can look the app, the interface of the app, and all these kind of things. So first, I want to know if someone of you have an idea or what app we can create or something like that.”
AI: That sounds like a great approach! I totally agree that we need to define the type of app first. I’ve been thinking about maybe a productivity app, but I’m curious if you or our other teammate have any specific ideas in mind. So, what kind of app were you envisioning?
ME: “I really like the idea that you say it's a productive app, and I think it's really good for students in general. What do you think about that?”
AI: Absolutely, I think that’s a fantastic idea! A productivity app for students could definitely meet a real need. We could focus on features like task management, scheduling, and reminders. So, do you have any specific features or functionalities in mind that you’d like to include?
ME: “I agree with that, but I'm not sure if we just decide the target is just students, or we are focused in university students, or high school students, or what do you think is the best target that we can focus and dip in that?”
AI: That’s a great point! Narrowing down the target audience definitely helps. We could focus on university students, since they often juggle a lot of tasks and deadlines. But we could also consider high school students if we want to keep it broader. What do you think would be more beneficial or more interesting for our project?
ME: “Okay, I agree. Definitely, we can choose university students. So, now that we decide what type of app we want to create, maybe the target that is the app, we have to decide what person do the research about the target, why it's a good idea, like the investigation, the research about that, and maybe the other person is focused to create a presentation, and the other person is the person who finds examples that exist in the market, or I don't know.”
AI: Absolutely, that makes perfect sense! We can definitely divide the responsibilities that way. One person can focus on market research and understanding our target audience in depth, another can work on creating a compelling presentation to showcase our ideas, and the third person can look at existing apps in the market for inspiration. So, does that sound like a good plan for how we can divide the tasks?
ME: “I don't know if something is missing. Do you think that we have to do another thing? Because I think the presentation is important and we need a good design for the presentation, but we can focus on that in the last part of the project if we have all the information before. So I think we can do together the presentation, but I don't know if you agree with that or someone wants to do by themselves the presentation or not.”
AI: I completely agree! It definitely makes sense to gather all the information first before we dive into the presentation design. And I’m totally open to collaborating on that final part together. That way, we can ensure consistency and a really polished final result. So, I think we’re definitely on the same page! Let me know if you have any other ideas or if you want to add anything else.
ME: “No, I agree. If it's okay, I want to do the part in who is the research, the examples from the apps that exist to compare the market. I don't know, what do you think about the limit of doing all parts? What is better for you in this case?”
AI: That sounds great! I’m happy to take on the research or the presentation part, whichever works best for you. And I think we can set some clear deadlines for each part so that we stay on track. So, let me know what timeline works for you, and we can coordinate it nicely.
ME: “So, we have one month to do all the project, so I don't know if we used two weeks to make all the research and have all the information that we need, and no, I don't know, maybe just, yeah, two weeks for that, for deadline, and the other two weeks to create a presentation and maybe design a basic of how looks the app and all these kind of things or what do you think that is a long time or short time for that or what is the best deadline for each person, I don't know.”
AI: I think your plan sounds really balanced! Giving two weeks for research definitely allows us to gather everything thoroughly, and then having the next two weeks for the presentation and design is perfect. That way, we have a nice buffer for revisions and final touches. I think it’s a great timeline, and it should keep us on track and stress-free. Let me know if you want to adjust anything, but I think we’re good to go!
ME: “Okay, if everyone is agree with that, I want to suggest another thing, like, if it's possible to each week see what things are done and where things are, we have, we need to improve, so have a meeting per week, that it's okay, let me know which day for you is good for that, I think for me, on Thursday in the afternoon, it's okay, so what do you think about that?”
AI: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Having weekly check-ins will definitely help us stay on track and address any issues early on. Thursday afternoons work well for me too, so that should be perfect. I’m looking forward to staying connected and making great progress together! Let’s do it!
ME: “Okay, so now, I don't know, I don't have clear what part you decide to do on the project, so if you let me know what is your part, I'm happy if you told me, please.”
AI: Of course! I’m happy to help out with the presentation and the design part, making sure it all looks polished and cohesive. That way, you can focus on the research and market comparison. And of course, we can always collaborate and support each other along the way. Sound good?
ME: “Okay, sounds good. Now that we know which part we need to do, I think for now it's okay if we finish the meeting and we start to work. If someone has a question or a problem, please let us know in the WhatsApp group that we have. Yeah, I think that's for today or now, right?”
AI: Absolutely, that sounds perfect! We’ve got everything laid out, and we can definitely keep in touch through the group if anything comes up. I’m excited to get started, and I’m sure we’ll do great. So, let’s jump in and make some awesome progress!
ME: “Okay, so the next meeting is the next Thursday, so we can talk about what's happened this day, or if you need a more quick meeting, we can decide another day, but for the moment, just see you on Thursday in the meeting.”
AI: That sounds like a great plan! We’ll keep Thursday on the schedule, and if anything urgent pops up, we can always arrange another quick check-in. I’m looking forward to seeing what we accomplish by then. Thanks so much, and I’ll talk to you soon!
ME: “Okay, thank you, have a good day.”
AI: You too! Have a great day, and I’ll talk to you soon. Take care!
ME: “Thank you. Bye-bye.”
AI: Bye-bye! Take care and talk to you soon!

Task 3: Responding to Feedback or a Performance Review:

Prompt: “I want to practice how to respond to feedback or a performance review. You're a teacher who told me what kind of things I need to improve or what things are good, and I will play the role of a student. Please create a realistic scenario and keep going with the conversation naturally.”

AI: Absolutely, that sounds great! Let's jump right in.
So, imagine I'm your teacher and we've just finished a semester. Overall, you've done really well in some areas, but there are a few points we can improve.
Alright, let me start. "Hi! I wanted to talk about your performance this semester. First off, you've shown great improvement in participation and your assignments have been very thorough. However, I'd like to see a bit more consistency in meeting deadlines and also some more engagement during group discussions. How do you feel about that?"
Now, over to you as the student!
ME: “Hi, I understand what are you saying to me about the deadlines meeting. Sometimes it's very hard for me to have the deadlines because some of our projects need to use a specific software or three-dimensional program. So sometimes I have problems with my computer. So it's things that I can control, but I know if I have these problems, I try to find a solution about that or a, I don't know, doing with more time, but sometimes it's something that I can control, I think.”
AI: Absolutely, that makes sense. I appreciate your honesty. It's definitely challenging when technical issues come up. One thing we could consider is maybe giving you a bit more flexibility or planning ahead for those issues. And I'm glad to hear you're proactive about finding solutions. How do you think we could better support you in managing those challenges in the future?
ME: “For instance, but it's not your problem, it's a problem in general in the university. I think a good thing to change is that they give us the license for some programs, because sometimes because we don't have the license, it's difficult to use the software. So I think this is something that should change for better. At the same time, maybe some computer rooms that the university has, maybe have more time to be open or be more open for the students, because we know that they exist, but we don't know exactly what time we can use. The management is not good, so maybe improve that, but maybe it's a general problem that the university has. And about the engagements during the group discussions, this is so difficult for me, because I'm a little bit shy to say something, so I just prefer to think in my mind and listen to people, and I find it interesting, but for me it's difficult to speak in front of everyone, and they maybe make a mistake or something, so I don't know, it's very hard.”
AI: I totally understand, and I appreciate you sharing that. It's definitely a common challenge, and it’s important to have the right resources and support. I’ll definitely keep that in mind and pass along your feedback. And regarding the group discussions, that’s completely understandable. Maybe we can explore some smaller group settings or other ways to help you feel more comfortable. We’ll definitely work together on that. Is there anything else you’d like to add or any other areas where you feel you need more support?
ME: “Yes, I want to know about my last presentation for the last project in the semester, I want to know how I did it, if the presentation was good or something was missing, what do you think about that?”
AI: Of course! So, your presentation was actually quite solid. You had a clear structure, and your visuals were well done. One area for improvement would be to engage the audience a bit more—maybe ask some questions or encourage discussion. Also, there were a few points where you could have elaborated a bit more. But overall, it was really good! How do you feel about the feedback? And is there anything specific you’d like to focus on improving next time?
ME: “Could you tell me some examples about, ask some questions on Anchorage discussions, because I don't know how to do that. I don't know. It's difficult.”
AI: Absolutely, I can help with that! For example, you could start by asking open-ended questions like, "What do you think about this approach?" or "Does anyone have any different perspectives?" Another idea is to invite a specific person to share their thoughts or even present a hypothetical scenario and ask the group how they would respond. It’s really about creating a comfortable space for everyone to contribute. We can definitely practice some of these techniques together if you'd like!
ME: Okay, I see what you mean. Thank you for letting me know. And yeah, I would like to practice some of these techniques together if we have time. Another thing that I want to ask is about... In the presentation, I put some information and I don't know if the... If the reference was good or not, because sometimes it's difficult to use APA rules. So I don't know if it was okay or not. And I want to know what do you think about the immigration, about the presentation in general. Like if I have to put less text or more image or it was correct. I don't know.
AI: Of course, that’s a great question! Overall, your references were quite solid, and you followed the APA guidelines pretty well. There were just a couple of minor formatting tweaks needed, but nothing major. As for your slides, you did a great job balancing text and visuals. Maybe just a bit more imagery and a little less text on some slides could help keep the audience engaged. But overall, you did really well! We can definitely dive into more details and practice those techniques whenever you’re ready. Sound good?
ME: “Yes, sounds good. I want to know if you want to say another thing that I could improve in general in the class or everything is okay and it's just that.”
AI: Absolutely! I think overall, you did really well, and you’ve shown a lot of growth. One small area we could work on is maybe time management for assignments, just to ensure everything is submitted on time. And also, maybe a bit more active participation in smaller group activities, just to build that confidence. But you’re definitely on the right track, and I’m here to support you all the way. Let me know if there’s anything else on your mind!
ME: “To finish, in general about the subject, my notes are good, and I know you didn't tell us yet how was the last score for the last presentation project, but I want to know if in general it was good, if I don't have problems with the subject in general, because I know I have some problems with the deadlines, but after that, after all, I always do my assignments in a good way, so I don't know if I don't gave the project in the deadline, I obtained a less score, or it was not a big problem.”
AI: I totally get what you mean! Overall, your performance in the subject is strong, and your assignments have been of high quality. The deadlines do play a role in the final score, but since you’ve been consistent with the quality of your work, it’s definitely not a major issue. We can definitely work on improving that time management to ensure you get the best possible grades. But rest assured, you’re on a great path, and I’m confident you’ll do well overall. If you have any other concerns, just let me know!
ME: “And now I think that's all. Thank you for telling me what things I need to improve and to understand the situation and listen to me about some things that you told me. Of course, it's something that I need to improve and I will try it. So thank you and I don't know, do you need something else or I can go for a break?”
AI: You're very welcome! I'm glad we could chat and that you found it helpful. I think you're on the right track, and I’m here if you need anything else. But if you're all set, then feel free to take a break, and we can always continue another time. Thanks for the great conversation!
ME: “Thank you, teacher. See you in the next class. Thank you. Bye-bye.”
AI: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to it. Take care and have a great rest of your day. Bye for now!
