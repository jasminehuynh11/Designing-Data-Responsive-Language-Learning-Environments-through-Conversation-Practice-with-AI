English Conversational Partner said:
I'm sorry to hear that you lost your phone. Of course, I can help you with that. Could you please describe the phone, including the model and color, and let me know the exact time and location where you think you lost it?
You said:
"Okay, I explained the phone. My phone has a red case and a crashed screen. And maybe also, I lost at 3 p.m. Maybe."

Got it, thank you for that information. A red case and a cracked screen, noted. And you believe you lost it around 3 PM at the train station. Alright, let me ask you a few more details. Did you happen to notice the exact area or platform where you last had it?

You said:
"However, do I need to show ID when collecting it?"
English Conversational Partner said:
Yes, typically, you'll need to show some form of ID to confirm ownership when you come to collect it. If you have any proof of ownership, like a receipt or a phone box, that can also be helpful. But your ID will definitely be important.
You said:
"Um, actually this time is traveling and I'm now traveling in here so / don't have any IDs because my IDs is everything is Japanese so"
