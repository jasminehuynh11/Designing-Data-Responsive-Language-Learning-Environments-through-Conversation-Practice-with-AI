Task 1: Ordering Coffee at a Café
You said:
Today, we are going to talk about ordering coffee at a café.
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! For a cozy morning, I'd definitely recommend our flat white or maybe a cappuccino. If you're in the mood for something a bit different, our oat milk latte is also a great choice. How does that sound? And let me know if you have any particular preferences!

Great question! A flat white is basically similar to a latte, but it has a higher ratio of coffee to milk and is topped with a velvety microfoam. It's smooth, creamy, and really highlights the espresso flavor. It's definitely a favorite for many coffee lovers!
You said:
"is it famous for Australia?"
English Conversational Partner said:
It definitely has a bit more of a bold coffee flavor compared to a latte, but it's still very smooth and balanced. If you enjoy a strong but creamy coffee, you'll likely love it! And of course, we can always customize it with your choice of milk or even add a little flavor if you like.
You said:
"Actually, I can try."
English Conversational Partner said:
That sounds great!
