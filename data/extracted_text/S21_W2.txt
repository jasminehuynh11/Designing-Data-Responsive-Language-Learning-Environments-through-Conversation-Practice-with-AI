Task 2: Visiting a Bank and Asking for Help with Banking Services Scenario
You said:
You are visiting a local bank branch or calling customer service to request help with everyday banking services. You may need to open a new account, update your details, or ask about specific features such as online banking or international transfers. Practise speaking clearly and politely in a formal setting. You will need to define the chatbot’s role as a bank staff or customer service officer. You can choose situations from the examples below; start with a simple request and try a more detailed interaction by asking about documents, account features, or banking procedures.
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course. I’ll take the role of a bank customer service officer.
Hello, welcome to Maple Bank. How can I help you today? Are you looking to open a new account, update your details, or ask about a specific service?
You said:
“Hi, I'd like to open my new saving account.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely! I'd be happy to assist you with that. May I start by confirming your identification details? Do you have a valid ID with you right now?
You said:
“Yeah, I have Penang passport.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, that works well. We’ll also need your proof of address. Could you provide a recent utility bill or a bank statement?
You said:
“I'm sorry.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all. Whenever you're ready, just let me know. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?
You said:
“Sorry, I couldn't understand your opinion, previous one, so could you tell me again?”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, no problem. I was just mentioning that we’ll need a proof of address, like a recent utility bill or bank statement, along with your passport. Let me know if you have those documents ready.
You said:
“okay so i'm not actually i'm an international student so i'm not student so i'd like i'm working i come i came here for working holiday so is it okay to bring only passport”
00:21
English Conversational Partner said:
Got it, that makes sense. Yes, your passport will definitely work as your ID. For proof of address, we can also consider a rental agreement or a letter from your employer if you have one. Let me know what you can provide.
You said:
“This is the only passport I can provide.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
That’s perfectly fine. We can proceed with your passport for identification. We may just need to verify your address in another way. Let me know if you have any questions or if you need help with the next steps.
You said:
“Can I also start up online banking today?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, we can set that up for you today as well. I’ll guide you through the process. Do you have a valid email address that we can use to register your online banking?
You said:
“Okay, thank you. So, do I need to make an appointment, or can I walk in?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re welcome! You can absolutely walk in, but if you prefer, you can also make an appointment to ensure faster service. Whatever works best for you!
You said:
“So, could you have an appointment?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course, I can help you schedule that. Could you let me know what date and time would be most convenient for you?
You said:
“Is it available to come this afternoon?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
Let me check that for you. We do have availability this afternoon. What time would you prefer, around 2 PM or maybe a bit later?
You said:
“2 p.m. is fine.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
Great, I’ll schedule you for 2 PM this afternoon. If you need any further assistance before your appointment, just let me know. Looking forward to seeing you then!
You said:
“Thank you, and do I need to something to do before I go, I come?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
You’re welcome! Just make sure to bring your passport and any proof of address you have, and we’ll handle the rest. If you have any questions before then, feel free to reach out.
You said:
“Thank you.”
00:01
English Conversational Partner said:
