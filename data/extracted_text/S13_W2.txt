Task 1: Visiting a Medical Clinic and Booking or Changing an Appointment
You said: “I am an English student and I would like to practice a scenario where you will be a receptionist in a medical clinic and I will be a patient because I need to schedule an appointment because I am sick. Can you help me?”
00:21
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, I’d be happy to help! Let’s get started. So, I’ll be the receptionist at the clinic.
Hello! Welcome to our medical clinic. How can I assist you today? Are you looking to schedule an appointment?
You said:
“Yes, please, today I don't feel really well, I am feeling sick, and I will have to visit a doctor.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
I’m sorry to hear that you’re not feeling well. Let’s get you taken care of. Could you please tell me what symptoms you’re experiencing, and also what day and time would work best for you?
You said:
“Well, today I feel fever, but yesterday I have a sore throat.”
00:07
English Conversational Partner said:
I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. Got it—fever and a sore throat. Let’s see… would you prefer to come in today, or would another day this week be better for you?
You said:
“Today is a little difficult because I don't have enough time, but it's somewhat available maybe tomorrow morning.”
00:09
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, let me check our schedule for tomorrow morning. We do have some openings. What time would be most convenient for you, and do you have a preferred doctor if you have one?
You said:
“อืม อาจว่า 10 นาที”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Perfect, 10 a.
You said:
“Do you have a specialist or is it a general doctor?”
00:05
English Conversational Partner said:
We have both general practitioners and specialists available. If you prefer a general doctor, we can definitely schedule you for that. Otherwise, if you have a specific specialist in mind, just let me know!
You said:
“Do you have any recommendation, considering my symptoms?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Certainly! Given your fever and sore throat, a general practitioner would be a great start. If needed, we can always arrange for an ENT specialist later on. Would you like me to book you with a general practitioner for tomorrow at 10 a.m.?
You said:
“And... yeah, it's... it's okay.”
00:02
English Conversational Partner said:
Great, that’s all set then! I’ll book you for tomorrow at 10 a.m. with our general practitioner. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
You said:
“I have some questions.”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Of course! Feel free
You said:
“Will I need a blood test for this type of checkup?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
That depends on what the doctor finds during the initial consultation. Usually, if it's needed, the doctor will let you know and schedule it for a later time. But we can definitely discuss that once you see the doctor. Let me know if you have any other questions!
You said:
“Okay, but if he sent me the blood test, I would like to know if I could request a copy of my result after the visit. Is possible?”
00:11
English Conversational Partner said:
Absolutely, you can definitely request a copy of your results. We’ll provide them to you either electronically or on paper, whichever you prefer. And we can also help you with that after your visit. Just let us know!
You said:
“Okay, perfect.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
Great! I'm glad we could sort that out. If you have any more questions or need anything else, just let me know. Otherwise, we'll see you tomorrow at 10 a.m.!
You said:
“Oh yes, I have more questions because I don't know if I need an insurance or Medicare.”
00:08
English Conversational Partner said:
No worries at all! We can definitely help with that. If you have insurance, just bring your insurance card, and we’ll verify it for you. If you’re covered by Medicare, we can assist with that as well. Just let us know what you have, and we’ll guide you through the process!
You said:
“And how long is the appointment likely to take?”
00:03
English Conversational Partner said:
Typically, a general appointment for something like a fever and sore throat might take around 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the examination and any follow-up questions. If any tests are needed, that might add a bit more time, but we’ll make sure to keep it efficient for you.
You said:
“Thank you, thank you. Yeah, I think I don't have more questions. What is the name of the doctor?”
00:06
English Conversational Partner said:
You're very welcome! The doctor is a licensed general practitioner with lots of experience, so you’ll be in good hands. If anything else comes up, just let me know. Otherwise, I’ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow at 10 a.m.!
You said:
“Ah perfect, I really appreciate your time, thank you.”
00:04
English Conversational Partner said:
It’s absolutely my pleasure! I'm glad I could help. If you think of anything else, just reach out. Take care, and I’ll see you tomorrow!
You said:
“Thanks.”
00:00
English Conversational Partner said:
You're very welcome! Have a great day, and I’ll be here if you need anything else. Take care!

You said:
“Thank you.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Awesome! I'll get to work on that, and once I have some options, I'll share them with you. If you think of anything else in the meantime, just let me know!
You said:
“But maybe do you have a lease or the apartments that you are now renting?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! I can definitely provide details on the lease terms, whether it’s a short-term or a long-term lease, and any other conditions the apartments have. Once I find some suitable options, I'll include all that information for you!
You said:
“But, can you give me information now?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Of course! I can definitely share some general info right away. Typically, most apartments in that price range might have lease terms ranging from six months to a year. And a lot of them will include utilities like water and gas, though electricity might be separate. I’ll definitely confirm all these details as I find specific listings for you.
You said:
“Do you have any property for Niche?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Yes, absolutely! There are definitely furnished options available as well. I can look specifically for furnished apartments that match your criteria, including the budget, location, and amenities. I'll make sure to highlight those for you as well!
You said:
“Okay, but furnished in my budget, considering my budget.”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I’ll focus on finding furnished options that fit within your $400 per week budget. Sometimes it can be a bit more challenging, but I’ll definitely do my best to find some great options for you. I’ll get started on that right away!
You said:
“Do you have any option now to look in Google Maps?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
I found a few furnished options, but they do tend to be a bit above the $400 per week budget. For example, some are around $1,200 per week in central areas. It might help to expand the search to nearby suburbs or adjust the budget a bit. But I’m definitely happy to keep looking and find the best fit for you!
You said:
“And what is the other is?”

ChatGPT said:
I found a furnished studio apartment at 98/289-295 Sussex Street in Sydney’s CBD, and it’s listed for about $60 per week. It’s conveniently close to supermarkets and also includes parking. Let me know if you'd like more details!Homely

“Okay, and what documents do I need to include with my application?”

Typically, you'll need a few key documents, such as a valid photo ID, proof of income (like recent pay slips or a bank statement), and sometimes a rental reference or a reference from a previous landlord. If there's anything specific required, I'll let you know, but those are usually the main ones.
You said:
“Okay, and once I apply for the department, how long does it take to hear back?”

Got it! If you're asking about the land or the property itself, typically the details will include information about the building's location, the surrounding amenities, and any specific features of the land, like green spaces or nearby facilities. If you have any specific questions about that, just let me know, and I can give you more details!
You said:
“to know about the length of the contract.”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see! So, when it comes to the length of the contract, typically rental agreements can range from six months to a year, and sometimes even longer if you prefer. If you’re looking for something shorter or more flexible, we can definitely explore those options as well. Just let me know what kind of lease term you're comfortable with!
You said:
“Yeah, I'm talking about the apartment that you told me in Sydney.”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
Got it! For that specific apartment in Sydney, the lease length is usually flexible. Often, you can choose between a six-month lease or a twelve-month lease, and sometimes even a shorter-term lease if needed. I can confirm the exact terms for that particular property and let you know the details as well!
You said:
“When could I go to make an inspection?”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
You can usually schedule an inspection by contacting the property manager or the real estate agency. They often have set times for viewings, but you can also request a private inspection at a time that works for you. Once you let me know your availability, I can help coordinate that, and we'll make sure you get to see the apartment in person!
You said:
“Okay, perfect.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Awesome! I'm glad we could go through all that. If you have any more questions or need help with anything else as you move forward, just let me know. I'm here to help!
You said:
“Yes, to be honest, I am new in this city, so I don't know what makes a strong rental application. Do you have any advice?”
00:09
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Absolutely! A strong rental application usually includes a few key things:
First, having a stable income or proof of employment is really helpful. It shows that you can consistently pay rent. Second, providing good references, like from previous landlords or employers, can really strengthen your application. And third, having all your documents ready in advance, like your ID, proof of income, and any rental history, makes the process smoother. And of course, being responsive and prompt with communication always helps as well. If you need any more tips, I'm happy to help!
You said:
“Yeah, because I am new in Sydney, I don't have a rental history in Australia. Can I still apply?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Absolutely, you can still apply! In that case, landlords often consider other factors, like your employment stability, your credit history, and personal references. You can also provide a reference from a previous landlord in your home country, or even a character reference from an employer. Landlords are often understanding, especially if you can show that you’re reliable and have a steady income. If you need any help with that, I'm here for you!
You said:
“If someone else also applies, how do you choose?”
00:05
ChatGPT said:
Great question! Landlords and property managers typically look at a combination of factors. They consider the stability of your income, your rental history if you have it, your references, and sometimes even your credit score. They also look at how quickly you respond and communicate. Ultimately, it’s about finding someone who meets all the requirements and is also a good fit for the property. If you have any concerns, just let me know, and I'll help you navigate it!
You said:
“Yes, in case that you give me the opportunity to rent the apartment, do I pay the bond before signing the lease?”
00:10
ChatGPT said:
Yes, typically the bond, which is a security deposit, is paid before you sign the lease or at the same time. It’s usually one or two weeks' worth of rent, and it’s held as a form of security in case of any damages. Once everything is agreed upon, you’ll sign the lease, and then the bond is paid. If you have any questions about that process, I’m here to help!
You said:
“Just one more, if I break the list early, what are the consequences?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Great question! If you break the lease early, there can be a few consequences. Usually, you might be responsible for paying rent until a new tenant is found, or you might have to cover any advertising costs or administrative fees. Sometimes, landlords might also withhold a portion of your bond. It really depends on the terms of the lease and the landlord’s policies. It’s always a good idea to discuss it with the landlord in advance and see if there’s a way to come to a mutual agreement. Let me know if you need more specifics!
You said:
“No, not really. I'm very clear now.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, I'm really glad to hear that! If anything else comes up or you have more questions down the line, just let me know. I'm always here to help. Good luck with the apartment hunt, and I'm sure you'll find a great place!
You said:
“Thank you, I really appreciate your help.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome! I'm happy to help anytime. If you need anything else, just give me a shout. Good luck, and I hope everything goes smoothly with your move!
You said:
“Thanks, see you.”

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, talk to you soon! Take care and have a great one!
