Task 1:

You said :
I want to practise how to order coffee at a café. You are a barista working in a café in Sydney. I’ll play the role of a customer. Please create a realistic café scenario and respond as if we were really there. Ask me about my preferences, help me choose from the menu, and explain different coffee options. Keep the conversation going naturally by asking at least 3 follow-up questions about size, milk, and payment.
English Conversational Partner said :
Sure! [smiling as you walk up to the counter] Hey there, welcome to Harbour Brew Café — how’s your morning going so far? What kind of coffee are you after today?
You said :
“Hi, could I please get a cappuccino?”
English Conversational Partner said :
Of course! A cappuccino sounds great. Would you like that in a small, medium, or large size?
You said :
“What is the difference about medium and large sites?”
English Conversational Partner said :
Great question! So, our medium size is about 12 ounces, and the large is around 16 ounces, so you get a bit more of that delicious coffee and foam in the large. Which one are you leaning towards?
You said :
“And what is the difference of the price?”
English Conversational Partner said :
Absolutely! So, the medium cappuccino is about $4.50, and the large is around $5.50. So there's a little difference in price for that extra coffee. Does that help you decide?
You said :
“Okay, yeah, I will take a large cappuccino, but it's possible I have a different milk because I'm lactose-free.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Of course, we’ve got plenty of options! We can do almond milk, oat milk, or soy milk. Which one would you prefer for your cappuccino?
You said :
“Oh, I think I will take Almond Milk, yes.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Perfect choice! Almond milk will taste delicious in that cappuccino. Now, would you like to pay with card or cash
You said :
“I.E.”
English Conversational Partner said :
All right, great!
You said :
“Yes.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Awesome, so I'll get that large cappuccino with almond milk ready for you. And just let me know whenever you're ready to settle up!
You said :
“Yeah, uh, on the top they put, uh, normally, uh, chocolate powder or something different.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Yes, exactly! We usually sprinkle a little chocolate powder on top, but if you prefer something else, like cinnamon or just plain foam, just let me know. How would you like it?
You said :
“Okay, can I have a double portion of chocolate powder?”
English Conversational Partner said :
Absolutely, we can do that! I’ll make sure to add extra chocolate powder on top for you. That’s going to be delicious! Is there anything else I can get for you?
You said :
“Maybe I will take a donut or something to eat together. What do you have?”
English Conversational Partner said :
Oh, absolutely! We’ve got a variety of donuts, like glazed, chocolate frosted, and even some filled ones. Which type of donut are you in the mood for?
You said :
“and maybe like a cross-sort.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Absolutely, we've got some fresh, flaky croissants as well! You can choose from plain, almond, or even chocolate-filled. Which one would you like to add to your order?
You said :
“Do you have some croissant with gluten-free?”
English Conversational Partner said :
Of course! We do have gluten-free croissants available. I’ll make sure to get that gluten-free option for you. That sounds perfect! Anything else you'd like to add?
You said :
“Okay, I will take a croissant gluten-free, raspberry, you have raspberry, or with Nutella? Which one you have?”
English Conversational Partner said :
Yes, we do have both raspberry and Nutella options for our gluten-free croissants! They’re both really popular. Which one are you in the mood for today?
You said :
“Okay, I think I will take a raspberry one.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Perfect choice! A gluten-free raspberry croissant it is. Alright, so we’ve got your large cappuccino with almond milk, extra chocolate powder, and the raspberry gluten-free croissant. That sounds delicious! Let me know if there’s anything else you need.
You said :
“Yeah, and for my friends, it's possible to have a cold hot chocolate.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Absolutely, we can do that! I'll add a cold hot chocolate for your friend as well. That’ll be a nice treat. Anything else you’d like to add to your order?
You said :
“Yeah, for she, uh, the small please, if it's possible, the hot chocolate cold, and maybe we, she want take a muffin. You have a muffin with the apple.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Definitely! We can do a small cold hot chocolate for her, and we also have apple muffins available. That’ll be a lovely combination! I’ll get that all set up for you. Anything else you’d like to add?
You said :
“OK, perfect. There is a difference if we eat here or we take away, like the price is more or less.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Yes, typically there's a small difference. If you enjoy your order here, there’s usually a slight increase due to dine-in service, but it’s not too big. Just let me know what you prefer, and I’ll sort it out for you!
You said :
“I think I will take away if it's possible.”
English Conversational Partner said :
Absolutely, we’ll get everything packed up for you to go! That sounds great. I’ll have your cappuccino, the croissant, the hot chocolate, and the muffin all ready for takeaway. Let me know if there’s anything else you need!

You said :
“I have a little bit change idea. It's possible to remove the cappuccino and take an ice latte?”
English Conversational Partner said :
Of course, that’s no problem at all! I’ll switch out the cappuccino for an iced latte. That’ll be delicious! Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to adjust.
