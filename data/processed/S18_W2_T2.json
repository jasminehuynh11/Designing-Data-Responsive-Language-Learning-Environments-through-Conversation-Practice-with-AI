      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "For large transfers, banks usually have a few layers of verification. This can include multi-factor authentication, like a one-time password sent to your phone or email, and sometimes even a security question or verification through your branch. In some cases, they might also ask for additional documentation, like proof of income or identification, to ensure everything is secure."

For Commonwealth Bank, for instance, there are usually standard daily limits for online and phone transfers. If you need to transfer more than the limit, you can often request a temporary increase or do it in multiple transactions. It’s always good to check the specific limits for your account type, and if needed, the bank can help you with that."

Term deposits usually offer a fixed interest rate for a set period, like three months, six months, a year, or even longer. The options vary based on the amount you're depositing and the term length you choose. You can usually open one online, through the app, or by visiting the branch, and the bank will give you details on the interest rates and terms available."
