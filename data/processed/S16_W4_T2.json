So maybe we can lay out a study schedule that mixes your English practice with a bit of IT prep. Now, do you have a target date for when you’d like to start your master’s, so we can work backwards from there?"

So you could do general English first and then transition into some IELTS-specific prep as you get closer. Now, does that sound like a plan that would work for you?"

If I don't work full day, it's almost impossible. So, in the moment, I have work in companies as a laborer, in construction, as my staff is in big events. What you could advise me about it?”"

So if you need to juggle work and study, I’d say it’s totally fine to keep doing part-time jobs like barista or event work that fit around your schedule. That way you can earn while you improve your English and work toward your master’s goal. And over time, as your English gets stronger, you might find some small IT internships or part-time roles that can fit in. So does that sound like a workable balance for you?"
