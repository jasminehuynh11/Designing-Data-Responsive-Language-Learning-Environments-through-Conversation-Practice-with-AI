Now, let me ask you: would you prefer to start with that kind of diploma program to get familiar with the field, or do you want to jump straight into a master's program if possible?"

      "text": "Sure! So generally, doing a diploma first can help if you want a smoother entry into a master's, especially if you want to build up some local credentials. So my question for you is: do you feel like you'd be more comfortable easing in that way, or are you confident you want to jump straight into the master's program directly?"

      "text": "Absolutely, that's totally okay. We can work with that. In fact, starting with a diploma might actually give you some extra time to get comfortable with English. So would you like to go that route and get a bit more used to studying in English first, or do you have another idea in mind?"
