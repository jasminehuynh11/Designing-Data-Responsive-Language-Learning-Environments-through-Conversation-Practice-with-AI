      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Hey there! Great job today! I noticed your form was really solid, especially on those sprints. One thing to work on might be your breathing technique to keep your energy up. How do you feel about focusing on that next time?"

      "turn": 10,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Of course! So, one thing you did really well today was your anticipation of the opponent’s moves, which is awesome for defense. One area to improve on might be your footwork, just to make sure you’re staying balanced and can react quickly. How does that sound?"

      "turn": 16,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "For overall improvement, aiming for about three times a week is a great start. That way, you give your body enough time to rest and recover between sessions. And we can always adjust based on how you feel and your progress!"

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Well, since we’ve talked about your defensive skills and your kicking, I think the next focus could be on your overall endurance and stamina, just to keep your energy up throughout the game. Sounds like a plan?"
    },
