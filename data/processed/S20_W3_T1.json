I am reporting that the Internet in my apartment is not working. You must respond professionally and politely, but you should not always agree with me. Instead, ask clarifying questions, propose troubleshooting steps, or explain why the issue might not be directly caused by the service."

So I checked my connection and I saw that the Wi-Fi doesn't work. I have like a message that there is no service. So I tried to restart my router but it doesn't change anything.”"

Maybe there is a technical available today?”"

Also, checking if the cables are firmly connected can help. Let me know if you want to give that a try, and I’ll be here to guide you through it."

After that, plug the modem back in first and give it a minute to fully restart. Then, plug the router back in and wait for it to reconnect. Once everything’s back on, check if your connection is stable. Let me know how it goes!"
