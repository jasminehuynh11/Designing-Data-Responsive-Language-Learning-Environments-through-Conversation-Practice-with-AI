    },

      "turn": 23,

      "turn": 24,

      "text": "Sure, updating the app doesn’t change your login details. After we finish opening your account, we’ll give you a temporary username and a one-time password so you can sign in the first time. Then the app will ask you to create your own permanent password. Which method would you prefer for receiving that one-time password — SMS to WhatsApp or email?"

    {
      "turn": 27,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "Thank you for that, I really appreciate it. But I would like to know about what's the difference between the save account and investment account. Do you have invesment account?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 28,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Sure, good question. Yes, we do offer investment accounts. A savings account is mainly for keeping your money safe and earning a small, stable interest. An investment account can grow your money faster, but the value can go up and down with the market. What kind of goal do you have in mind — short-term saving or longer-term investment?"
    },

      "turn": 30,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Sure. For our standard savings account, the interest rate is 2.1% per year, fixed and low-risk. For an investment account, the return isn’t fixed — it usually ranges between 4% and 10% per year, but it can be lower or higher depending on market performance. What level of risk are you comfortable with — very low, moderate, or higher risk?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 31,

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Alright, for our higher-risk investment options, the typical annual return ranges between about 8% and 14%, though it can vary more because it depends on market movement. To recommend the right product, could you tell me how long you’re thinking of investing this money — short term, like 1–2 years, or longer term?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 33,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "I need to think about that, maybe the other options, but for now I only want to open a save account and I really appreciate you send me the email with the information to use the application and if it's possible just send me the information about higher investment risk. Thank you so much."
    },
    {
      "turn": 34,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Of course, thank you for letting me know. I’ll send the email with your app login instructions, along with a separate summary of our higher-risk investment options. If you need anything else, feel free to contact us. Have a great day."
