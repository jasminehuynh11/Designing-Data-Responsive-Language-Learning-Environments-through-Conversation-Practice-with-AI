      "turn": 23,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Awesome, that sounds perfect! So, let’s start by checking the router’s lights to see if anything looks off. You can point the camera at the router, and I’ll guide you step-by-step. If needed, we can try rebooting it once more, and I’ll let you know what to look for. Sound good?"
