Once it’s off, press and hold the volume up button and the power button at the same time. Keep holding those buttons until you see the Samsung logo appear, and then you can release them. After that, you should see the recovery menu. Use the volume keys to navigate up and down, and the power button to select options. You can try the “Wipe cache partition” option first, and then reboot the system. If that doesn’t help, there are other options in the recovery menu, like performing a factory reset, but that will erase your data, so it’s good to back up if possible. Just let me know if you need any more details on any of those steps!"
