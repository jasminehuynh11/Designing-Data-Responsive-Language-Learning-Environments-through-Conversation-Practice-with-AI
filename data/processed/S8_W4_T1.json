      "speaker": "bot",

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "All right, that sounds like a fun goal! Using Python to maybe automate some 3D tasks or create tools for your 3D art is a great idea. So I'd say start with some beginner Python courses and then you can tie it into your Blender work over time. Is there anything else you want to know before you dive in?"

      "turn": 40,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, Unity is another great choice if you want to get into 3D modeling for games or interactive media. So if you're leaning that way, you could definitely start looking at some Unity tutorials as well. How about you just pick one of these areas to focus on first, and then you can add more as you go along?"

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, I think that's a great idea. Combining those three—Blender for modeling, Python for scripting, and Unity for bringing things to life—can really open up a lot of possibilities for you. So yeah, just take it step by step, and you’ll be on a good path. Anything else you’re curious about before we wrap up?"

      "text": "Sure, so to handle your economics background, I'd say you can just treat it as a bonus skill set that can come in handy down the road. It’s always useful to have that knowledge, even if you're shifting to a more creative or technical field. So just keep it in your back pocket and focus on what excites you right now. Anything else on your mind?"
