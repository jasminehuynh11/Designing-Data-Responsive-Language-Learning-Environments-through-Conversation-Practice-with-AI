Once you have that, just type it into your browser, and then we can go from there. Let me know if you need more guidance!"

If you haven’t changed them, the default credentials are usually something like “admin” for both fields, but let me know if you have any trouble with that. Once you’re logged in, we can check for any firmware updates."
