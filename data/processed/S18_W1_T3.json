But if it’s more significant or you’d prefer a new one, returning it is definitely an option. It kind of depends on how comfortable you are with it."

Others might require tags to be intact. It’s always best to double-check with them, but it’s definitely worth asking!"

You’ll usually need to contact their customer service, provide some evidence like photos, and they’ll either send you a replacement or issue a refund. It’s always good to check their specific policy just to be sure."
