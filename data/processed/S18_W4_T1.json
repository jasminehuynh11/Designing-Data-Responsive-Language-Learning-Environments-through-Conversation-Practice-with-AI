You could also consider improving your language skills if you're looking at non-English-speaking countries. Another great step is to get involved in literary communities, maybe join book clubs or write reviews. And of course, looking into scholarships and application requirements early on can be super helpful. Let me know if you want more specific info!"

      "turn": 11,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Great question! A diploma is usually a shorter program, often taking about one to two years, and it's more focused on practical skills and foundational knowledge. A master's degree, on the other hand, is typically more in-depth and research-oriented, often taking about one to two years as well, but with a heavier emphasis on advanced theory, research projects, and specialized topics. So it really depends on how deep you want to go and what your career goals are!"

      "text": "That’s a great question! Some signs could include feeling consistently uninterested or unmotivated, struggling to engage with the material, or not seeing how it connects to your goals or interests. Another sign might be if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or bored despite putting in effort. It can also show up if you don't feel supported by the teaching style or the course structure. Ultimately, it's all about how you feel and whether it aligns with what you enjoy and want to achieve."
