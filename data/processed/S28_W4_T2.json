If you’re eager to dive into the workforce and get hands-on experience, starting work right after graduation might be the best choice. On the other hand, if you want to specialize further or open up more advanced career paths, pursuing further study could be beneficial.

In general, it can be a bit more challenging to transition from studying in your home country to studying overseas, mainly because of different academic systems, cultural differences, and sometimes language barriers. However, many programs are designed to support international students, and with the right preparation, it’s definitely manageable. And having that international experience can be really valuable in the long run!"

Studying overseas can give you access to a broader network, exposure to international companies, and often a deeper understanding of global markets. It can definitely enhance your resume and potentially make you more competitive in the job market. But it also depends on the industry and the specific job you’re aiming for. It’s definitely an advantage to consider!"

To get started, I’d recommend identifying the companies or industries that interest you most, and then tailoring your resume and cover letter to highlight relevant experiences. It’s also helpful to start networking early, perhaps attending industry events or connecting with professionals on platforms like LinkedIn. And of course, planning ahead and setting clear goals will definitely help you along the way!"

Also, staying curious and open to new experiences can keep you motivated. It’s helpful to remind yourself of the bigger picture and stay flexible, adjusting your path as you learn more. And of course, seeking support from mentors or peers can really help keep you inspired."
