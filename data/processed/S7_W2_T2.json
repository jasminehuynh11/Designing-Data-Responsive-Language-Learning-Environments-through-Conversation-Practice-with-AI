      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Yes, absolutely! Students can open savings accounts too. We just need to confirm a few details. Could you tell me if you already have any other account with our bank, or will this be your first one here?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "speaker": "learner",

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Of course! For university students, we usually offer two main options: a basic savings account with no monthly fees, and a student saver account that gives a bit more interest if you deposit regularly. Yes, you can definitely manage both types online — through our app or website. Would you like me to explain the main differences between the two account types?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 7,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "Yes, please. I'm sorry for my poor English, what's the word deposit mean?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "No worries at all — your English is clear! The word “deposit” means to put money into your bank account. For example, when you get money from a part-time job and add it to your account, that’s a deposit. So, here’s the difference: The basic savings account is simple — no monthly fee, and you can use it anytime. The student saver account gives a higher interest rate, but you need to deposit a small amount each month to keep that rate. Do you think you’d prefer something simple, or would you like to earn extra interest by saving regularly?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "speaker": "learner",

    },
    {
      "turn": 10,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Yes, that sounds perfect for you! Since you have a regular part-time job, the student saver account would suit you well — you can deposit a small amount each month and earn more interest on your savings. Could you tell me what kind of ID you have with you today — for example, a passport, student card, or national ID?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 11,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "I have a student card and national ID. I forgot to ask this. Could I use a debit card with this account?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 12,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Yes, you can! Every savings account comes with a debit card, which you can use to withdraw cash, shop online, or make payments in stores. Would you like your debit card to be a physical card, a digital one for your phone, or both?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 13,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "I have already made this card, so I'll use this, thank you. It's OK, could you start opening my account?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 14,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Perfect, that makes it easier! Since you already have a card, we’ll just link it to your new savings account. I’ll need a few details to start — could you please tell me your full name as it appears on your ID?"
