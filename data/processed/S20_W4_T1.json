Scenario: I am discussing my current study plans and future career options. You must respond professionally and politely, but you should not always agree with me. Instead, ask clarifying questions, provide suggestions, and explain possible pathways."

      "text": "“Okay, now I'm just studying in the ILC school in Sydney, just English, because I have to improve my English. But in a few weeks, exactly in three weeks, I become graduate, so I have to decide if I want to stay more in this English school, or maybe change and do some course about some topic but I'm not sure because maybe I can just extend my course at this school and learn more English, or I can go to work.”"

      "turn": 10,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Of course! It really depends on what balance you’re looking for. For example, if you continue studying English full-time, you’ll definitely improve faster, but it might limit your work opportunities. On the other hand, part-time English courses can give you more flexibility to explore work or internships. So, do you think you’d prefer a more intensive language focus, or are you hoping to gain some work experience at the same time?"

      "turn": 12,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That makes perfect sense. It might be helpful to look into part-time jobs that are flexible and allow you to continue your English studies. That way, you get practical experience and keep improving your language skills. Would you like some guidance on how to find suitable part-time work or maybe how to balance both?"

      "turn": 14,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, I can definitely help with that. If you let me know the name of your current school, I can look into whether they have partnerships with local colleges or if they offer pathways to further courses. Feel free to share the name or any details you have, and we’ll go from there."

They also provide flexible study options, including part-time English courses. So, we can definitely explore how you can combine that with part-time work. Let me know if you’d like more details on any particular pathway or have any other questions!"
