      "text": "“Oh yes, thank you. I have another question about the rental options, because I'm not very sure that my partner will stay at this unit for more than a year, so is that okay if we can negotiate the lease length later?”"
    },

      "turn": 33,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, that’s definitely possible! We can often be flexible with the lease terms, and we can discuss and negotiate the duration that works best for both of you. Just let us know your preferences, and we’ll tailor the arrangement accordingly. Feel free to bring it up anytime!"

      "turn": 34,

    },
    {
      "turn": 35,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Great question! Usually, once you’re approved, we can arrange a move-in date that works for you. Often, it can be as soon as the lease is signed and the bond is paid, but it can also depend on the current tenant’s move-out date. We’ll do our best to accommodate your schedule and make the transition as smooth as possible. Just let us know what works best for you!"
    },

      "turn": 36,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Yes, that's perfect. I have a question. I think I have an issue with some of the documents. I can't find the employment agreement with my previous job. Is that okay if I provide it later? Because I understand that there is a lot of application for the unit at the moment. I don't want to miss it.”"

      "turn": 37,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, that's understandable! We can definitely work with you on that. You can submit the application with the documents you have right now, and then provide the employment agreement later. We’ll keep your application in good standing, and we’ll do our best to ensure you don’t miss out. Just let us know if you need any help along the way!"
