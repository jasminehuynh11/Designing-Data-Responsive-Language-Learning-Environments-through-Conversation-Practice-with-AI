Overall, you've done really well in some areas, but there are a few points we can improve. Alright, let me start. \"Hi! I wanted to talk about your performance this semester. First off, you've shown great improvement in participation and your assignments have been very thorough. However, I'd like to see a bit more consistency in meeting deadlines and also some more engagement during group discussions. How do you feel about that?\" Now, over to you as the student!"

      "text": "“Hi, I understand what are you saying to me about the deadlines meeting. Sometimes it's very hard for me to have the deadlines because some of our projects need to use a specific software or three-dimensional program. So sometimes I have problems with my computer. So it's things that I can control, but I know if I have these problems, I try to find a solution about that or a, I don't know, doing with more time, but sometimes it's something that I can control, I think.”"

      "turn": 4,

      "text": "Absolutely, that makes sense. I appreciate your honesty. It's definitely challenging when technical issues come up. One thing we could consider is maybe giving you a bit more flexibility or planning ahead for those issues. And I'm glad to hear you're proactive about finding solutions. How do you think we could better support you in managing those challenges in the future?"

      "turn": 5,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“For instance, but it's not your problem, it's a problem in general in the university. I think a good thing to change is that they give us the license for some programs, because sometimes because we don't have the license, it's difficult to use the software. So I think this is something that should change for better. At the same time, maybe some computer rooms that the university has, maybe have more time to be open or be more open for the students, because we know that they exist, but we don't know exactly what time we can use. The management is not good, so maybe improve that, but maybe it's a general problem that the university has. And about the engagements during the group discussions, this is so difficult for me, because I'm a little bit shy to say something, so I just prefer to think in my mind and listen to people, and I find it interesting, but for me it's difficult to speak in front of everyone, and they maybe make a mistake or something, so I don't know, it's very hard.”"

I’ll definitely keep that in mind and pass along your feedback. And regarding the group discussions, that’s completely understandable. Maybe we can explore some smaller group settings or other ways to help you feel more comfortable. We’ll definitely work together on that. Is there anything else you’d like to add or any other areas where you feel you need more support?"

One area for improvement would be to engage the audience a bit more—maybe ask some questions or encourage discussion. Also, there were a few points where you could have elaborated a bit more. But overall, it was really good! How do you feel about the feedback? And is there anything specific you’d like to focus on improving next time?"

      "turn": 10,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, I can help with that! For example, you could start by asking open-ended questions like, \"What do you think about this approach?\" or \"Does anyone have any different perspectives?\" Another idea is to invite a specific person to share their thoughts or even present a hypothetical scenario and ask the group how they would respond. It’s really about creating a comfortable space for everyone to contribute. We can definitely practice some of these techniques together if you'd like!"

Another thing that I want to ask is about... In the presentation, I put some information and I don't know if the... If the reference was good or not, because sometimes it's difficult to use APA rules. So I don't know if it was okay or not. And I want to know what do you think about the immigration, about the presentation in general. Like if I have to put less text or more image or it was correct. I don't know."

There were just a couple of minor formatting tweaks needed, but nothing major. As for your slides, you did a great job balancing text and visuals. Maybe just a bit more imagery and a little less text on some slides could help keep the audience engaged. But overall, you did really well! We can definitely dive into more details and practice those techniques whenever you’re ready. Sound good?"

One small area we could work on is maybe time management for assignments, just to ensure everything is submitted on time. And also, maybe a bit more active participation in smaller group activities, just to build that confidence. But you’re definitely on the right track, and I’m here to support you all the way. Let me know if there’s anything else on your mind!"

The deadlines do play a role in the final score, but since you’ve been consistent with the quality of your work, it’s definitely not a major issue. We can definitely work on improving that time management to ensure you get the best possible grades. But rest assured, you’re on a great path, and I’m confident you’ll do well overall.
