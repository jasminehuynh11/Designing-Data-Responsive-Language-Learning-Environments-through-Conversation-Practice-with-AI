      "turn": 15,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Great question! So, international marketing focuses on promoting products and understanding consumer behavior across different countries, while economics is more about studying how resources are allocated and understanding market forces on a broader scale. Both are really valuable, depending on what you’re interested in."

      "turn": 17,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Yeah, definitely! Marketing tends to be more hands-on and creative, and it’s in high demand, especially with digital platforms growing so quickly. It can definitely be a bit more approachable compared to economics. But we can explore both and see what fits you best!"

      "text": "That’s a great consideration! Gaining some work experience can definitely help you build practical skills and make you a more competitive candidate. But it’s not always mandatory. It really depends on the program and what you’re aiming for. We can definitely look into specific requirements and options together!"

Typically, relevant work experience could include internships in marketing, sales, or business development, or even roles in retail management that show leadership and customer interaction. Anything that demonstrates your understanding of business concepts will be helpful. Let me know if any of those sound like a good fit for you!"

      "turn": 23,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That really depends on your background and your goals. Sometimes a diploma can give you a solid foundation, and then you can jump into a master’s later. But if you already have some relevant experience or a related bachelor’s degree, you might be able to go straight into a master’s program. We can definitely explore what suits you best!"

      "text": "That’s a really good point. In many fields, experience and skills can be just as important, if not more so, than the degree itself. It really depends on the employer and the specific role. Sometimes having a degree can open doors, but it’s definitely possible to get into a great position with the right experience. We can definitely weigh those options together!"

      "turn": 31,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s a great question! It often comes down to your long-term goals and what you’re looking to gain. If you’re eager to dive into the workforce and get hands-on experience, starting work right after graduation might be the best choice. On the other hand, if you want to specialize further or open up more advanced career paths, pursuing further study could be beneficial. We can definitely explore what aligns best with your aspirations!"

      "turn": 33,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s a really insightful question! In general, it can be a bit more challenging to transition from studying in your home country to studying overseas, mainly because of different academic systems, cultural differences, and sometimes language barriers. However, many programs are designed to support international students, and with the right preparation, it’s definitely manageable. And having that international experience can be really valuable in the long run!"

      "turn": 35,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "In many cases, yes, it can definitely help! Studying overseas can give you access to a broader network, exposure to international companies, and often a deeper understanding of global markets. It can definitely enhance your resume and potentially make you more competitive in the job market. But it also depends on the industry and the specific job you’re aiming for. It’s definitely an advantage to consider!"

      "turn": 37,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s a great step! To get started, I’d recommend identifying the companies or industries that interest you most, and then tailoring your resume and cover letter to highlight relevant experiences. It’s also helpful to start networking early, perhaps attending industry events or connecting with professionals on platforms like LinkedIn. And of course, planning ahead and setting clear goals will definitely help you along the way!"

      "turn": 39,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s totally understandable! One way is to break your goals into smaller, manageable steps and celebrate each milestone. Also, staying curious and open to new experiences can keep you motivated. It’s helpful to remind yourself of the bigger picture and stay flexible, adjusting your path as you learn more. And of course, seeking support from mentors or peers can really help keep you inspired."
