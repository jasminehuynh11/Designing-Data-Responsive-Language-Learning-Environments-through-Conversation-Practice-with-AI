So, let’s take it step by step. We can definitely talk through how you can use your business management studies and what kind of career paths you might have in Australia. And we’ll figure out some practical next steps for you, all right?"

      "turn": 11,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Sure, I understand. Let’s break it down simply. So, you had a local company that was interested in you, and they wanted someone who could maybe drive as part of the job. And you were worried because you don't have a license, so you were thinking, \"Oh, maybe they'll replace me or something.\" But now it sounds like management is actually talking to you about your business management degree or your MBA and what that means. So we can talk about how that fits in and what steps you can take next."

That's what I want to ask.”"

    {
      "turn": 13,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, I understand. So yes, being honest with your management is a good idea. You can definitely let them know that you don't have a driver's license right now, but also highlight that you do have your business management degree and that you're eager to contribute in that area. So just being open and honest can actually help them see where you fit best, and it can help you feel a lot more comfortable."

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, and that's completely understandable. So to put it simply: yes, it’s absolutely okay to still be studying at university at your age. There’s no age limit on learning, and a lot of people go back to study at different stages in life. So during your school holidays, if you want to use that time to study a bit more or just to relax, that’s completely fine. Just go at your own pace and know that it's perfectly normal."

A lot of people have to try again. So, if that happens and you do need to re-sit or restart a portion, that's okay. We can talk about how to prepare for that and just take it one step at a time. You’re definitely not alone in that."

The important thing is just to take it step by step, and we can definitely find ways to help you study a bit more effectively or manage your time so that you feel more confident. But don’t worry, it’s totally normal, and you’re doing just fine."

First, you can make a simple plan for how you’ll prepare for that next test—just a bit of a study routine that’s manageable for you. And second, have an honest conversation with your management about what you can bring to the role with your business degree. Just these small steps will help you move forward."
