      "turn": 3,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, that sounds fun! Alright, I’ll be the barista. Whenever you’re ready, just let me know what you’d like to order, and we’ll take it from there!"

      "turn": 7,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Of course! Well, we have a classic cappuccino if you enjoy a balanced coffee with some foam, or if you like something sweeter, our vanilla latte is really popular. Do any of those sound good to you?"
    },

      "turn": 8,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“The lattes sound good. May I ask what is the cappuccino that you mentioned before?”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely! A cappuccino is made with equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam, so it’s a bit stronger and frothier. It’s perfect if you like a rich coffee flavor. Let me know if you’d like to try that instead!"
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "turn": 11,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Great question! So, a latte has more steamed milk and just a small amount of foam, making it creamier and a bit milder in flavor. Meanwhile, a cappuccino has more foam and less milk, so it’s a bit stronger and airier. It really depends on what you prefer!"
    },

    {
      "turn": 13,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Exactly, you got it! The cappuccino definitely has a more pronounced coffee flavor because of that balance of foam and espresso. So, if you like a bolder taste, that might be the way to go!"

      "turn": 14,

    },
    {
      "turn": 15,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Got it, that makes sense! In that case, a vanilla latte or maybe a caramel macchiato would be a great choice, since they’re a bit milder and sweeter. Would you like to try one of those?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 16,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Oh yeah, that sounds great. Maybe I will try the macchiato, the caramel one.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 17,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Perfect choice! A caramel macchiato is delicious and nicely balanced. Would you like it hot or iced today?"

      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Today is pretty hot, so I will get some ice, please.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 19,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, an iced caramel macchiato it is! That sounds refreshing. Anything else you’d like to add, maybe a pastry or something to go with it?"

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Yes, definitely! We do have a combo deal that includes two coffees and a slice of cake, so that works perfectly. I’ll get that all set for you! Anything else you’d like to add?"

    },
    {
      "turn": 27,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, I can add a mocha for your friend as well! So we’ll have the iced caramel macchiato for you, a mocha for your friend, and the almond cake. That sounds like a great order! Anything else before I finalize it?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 28,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“I have a question about the mocha. I don't know if the mocha has a very strong coffee taste as well, because my friend can drink strong coffee as well.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 29,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "I totally understand! A mocha does have espresso in it, but it’s balanced out with a good amount of steamed milk and chocolate, so it’s usually smoother and sweeter. It’s definitely less intense than a straight cappuccino. But if your friend prefers something even milder, we can definitely adjust the coffee strength. Just let me know!"
    },
    {
      "turn": 30,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Yes, thank you. Plea justice. She can't drink strong coffee.”"

      "turn": 32,

      "turn": 33,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "No worries at all! We do have almond milk available, so I’ll make sure to use that for her mocha. That’ll keep it nice and gentle for her. Anything else I can do for you?"

      "turn": 35,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely! We source our coffee beans from a variety of regions, but most of them come from places like Colombia and Ethiopia. They’re all specialty-grade beans, so they have really lovely, unique flavors. If you’re curious about a specific one, I’m happy to share more details!"
