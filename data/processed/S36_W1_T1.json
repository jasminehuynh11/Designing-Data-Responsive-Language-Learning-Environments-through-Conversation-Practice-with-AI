These farmers carefully hand-pick the coffee cherries, and then the beans are processed using a traditional washed method, which really highlights their bright and clean flavor. When it comes to roasting, we carefully use a medium roast profile to bring out those fruity and floral notes. It’s definitely a labor of love!"
