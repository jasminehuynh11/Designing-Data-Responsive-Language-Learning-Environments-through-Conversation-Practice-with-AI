      "turn": 46,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Great question! So, a flat white typically has a stronger espresso-to-milk ratio and a velvety microfoam, making it a bit more intense and less milky than a latte. On the other hand, a latte has more steamed milk and a lighter layer of foam, giving it a creamier, smoother texture. So it really depends on how strong and creamy you like your coffee!"

      "turn": 58,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, we can do that! I can definitely adjust the strength to be a bit lighter and use oat milk for a creamy, dairy-free option. That sounds like a delicious choice! Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to customize."
