This presentation about my hobby and not all students can understand my idea and specific information (i tried to give them too much facts about my hobby - wooden orthodox in Russia, may be i need choose another topics for international students?) . Your will start after my greeting and say me more about my mistakes and what i need change for my future presentation)"

      "turn": 2,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Alright, thanks for coming in. From what you’ve said, the biggest issue was clarity for an international audience, and your presentation had too many detailed facts, which made it hard for some students to follow. To help you better, what part of your presentation did you feel most unsure about?"

      "turn": 5,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Great! So, let’s dive in. One thing I noticed is that you included a lot of detailed historical facts about wooden Orthodox items in Russia, and that might have been overwhelming. In the future, focusing on broader concepts or simpler explanations might help. What do you think about adjusting the level of detail next time?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Maybe I agree, because before, I didn't think about people who will hear me, and I didn't understand what more people previously didn't read about Russian story and Russian architecture traditions.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 7,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, that makes sense. It's definitely important to consider the audience’s background and familiarity. Maybe next time, you can include some simpler explanations or even some visuals to help your audience connect more easily. Do you think that approach would work for you?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“What do you mean? I need use more visual effects, like just a picture, than speak more.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Exactly! Using visuals like pictures, diagrams, or even simple slides can help convey your message more clearly. That way, your audience can visualize what you’re talking about, and it makes it easier to understand. Do you think that could be a helpful strategy for your next presentation?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 10,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Oh, thank you. I mean that it's a good idea if I use more visual effects and try to make an easy presentation for all people who will be listening to me. But please give me more advice what I can use in this presentation if these people who will be listening to me from another country and also didn't meet these topics before.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 11,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely! In addition to visuals, you can also try using clear and simple language, avoiding jargon, and maybe sharing relatable examples or analogies. Another great idea is to engage your audience with questions or interactive elements to keep them involved. That way, you can make sure they stay interested and understand the content. Let me know if you’d like more specific tips!"

    {
      "turn": 12,

    },
    {
      "turn": 13,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That's a great question! A good approach is to start with a brief overview of your main points first, so everyone has the context. Then, you can go into more details and examples, and finally, open up for questions. This way, your audience has a solid foundation before diving into the details, and it makes it easier for them to follow along. Let me know if that helps!"
    },
    {
      "turn": 14,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Oh thank you, good idea. I agree with you, but at this time I don't understand what period of time I need to use when I talk about presentation. If my presentation is like past presentation, what you see before, this presentation has 10 pages and I speak about this maybe 15 minutes. If I have a presentation, if I will have a presentation with more pages and I will have more time to explain this, maybe I need to try to split this presentation into two parts and how I asked it before. I need previously speak with people about first part after answering for their questions and only after all of this start part two. What do you mean about it?”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 15,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "I think that approach can work really well! Splitting your presentation into parts can help keep your audience engaged and prevent information overload. You can introduce the first part, then pause for questions, and once everyone’s comfortable, move on to the second part. This way, you can ensure that they fully understand each section before moving forward. It definitely makes for a more interactive and digestible presentation. Let me know if you’d like to explore any other details!"

      "turn": 16,

    },
    {
      "turn": 17,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Of course! From what I gather, your presentation is about the tradition of wooden Orthodox artifacts in Russia, and you’re trying to share both historical context and cultural significance. The main challenge seems to be making the content accessible for an international audience who might not be familiar with the background. So, simplifying the language, using visuals, and breaking it into manageable sections will help. If there are any specific parts you’re unsure about, I’m happy to dive deeper!"
    },

      "turn": 18,

    },
    {
      "turn": 19,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s a great point! Usually, if you’re presenting to younger audiences, it’s best to keep things more straightforward and engaging, maybe with more visuals and simpler language. For older audiences or more advanced groups, you can add more depth and detail. So it really depends on who your audience is. The key is to match the complexity to their background and interest level. Let me know if that helps clarify!"
    },

      "turn": 20,

    },
    {
      "turn": 21,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Got it! Based on what you’ve shared, it sounds like your presentation has a lot of detailed historical and cultural information, which might be more suitable for older audiences or those with some background knowledge. For younger audiences, you might want to simplify and focus on the more engaging or visual aspects. But as it stands now, it leans a bit more toward an older audience. Hopefully that helps!"

    },
    {
      "turn": 23,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely! One additional piece of feedback would be to ensure that you have a clear structure, like a strong introduction and a concise conclusion, so your audience can easily follow along. Also, it can help to include relatable stories or personal anecdotes to make the content more engaging. Overall, you’re on the right track, and with a few adjustments, it’ll be even more effective! Let me know if you need more specifics."

      "turn": 24,

      "text": "“Yes, what I need to use in start of presentation, what pages, it's like a main topic of this, or I don't need to use structure of information. And in start, talk more about example, about picture what I have, and try say for my audience more information about interesting facts.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 25,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s a great approach! At the start, it’s often helpful to begin with a clear introduction that outlines your main topic and what your audience can expect. You can definitely use a compelling example or an intriguing picture to grab their attention right away. Then, you can gradually build on the information, mixing in interesting facts and engaging details. This structure helps keep everything organized and makes it easier for your audience to follow along. Let me know if you’d like more guidance on that!"

    },
    {
      "turn": 27,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s a great question! Using sound can definitely enhance your presentation, especially if you have background music or audio clips that relate to your topic. It can make it more engaging and help set the atmosphere. However, it’s also perfectly fine to rely on just spoken explanations and visuals if that fits your audience better. Ultimately, it’s about finding the right balance that keeps your audience engaged and helps them understand your topic best. Let me know if you have any specific ideas in mind!"
    },
    {
      "turn": 28,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Yes, I mean what if I use a soundtrack in this presentation and at the same time I try to talk about this topic. This is very noisy for audience and people cannot understand me.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 29,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Exactly, that’s a really good point! It’s important to keep the balance so that the soundtrack doesn’t overpower your voice. Usually, if you do include background music, you’ll want it to be soft and subtle, just to create an ambiance rather than distract. Another approach is to use sound effects at certain moments, while keeping your narration clear and straightforward. It’s definitely about finding that sweet spot so your audience can follow along easily. Let me know if you want any more tips on that!"

    },
    {
      "turn": 31,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "For an architecture presentation, a subtle, ambient soundtrack can work really well. For example, you could use soft instrumental music that evokes a sense of space and calm. You might also include soundscapes that reflect the environment, like city sounds, nature sounds, or even gentle ambient noise that complements the architectural theme. The key is to keep it gentle and unobtrusive so that it enhances rather than distracts. Let me know if you have a particular style in mind!"

      "turn": 32,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Can I use melody and sound from this church, or is this too much, and I need to talk only about architecture, not about confession or religious topics?”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 33,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s a really thoughtful question! Including melodies or sounds from a church can definitely add atmosphere and authenticity, especially if the architectural style is closely tied to that religious context. However, it’s important to be mindful of your audience and the overall tone. If you’re focusing purely on architecture, you can keep the sound elements subtle and ensure that they complement rather than overshadow the architectural content. Ultimately, it depends on the goal of your presentation and the comfort level of your audience. You can always experiment and see what feels right!"

And always these people didn't want understanding about confession topics because they always have confession who have from this country. For example, more people have a Catholic confession, maybe people from Saudi Arabia have Islam religion. It's not same. It's more important give for them more information about architecture and told about value of this architecture for human because these people didn't understanding what important in Orthodox Church. Yes, because it's not their religion, not their confession, just a building. But for me it's not just a building, it's very important for my culture, for my mentality.”"

      "text": "I completely understand. It’s definitely important to be mindful of the audience’s background and perspective. In that case, focusing on the architectural aspects, the design principles, and the cultural heritage behind the architecture can really help bridge that gap. By highlighting the universal values and the human experience reflected in the architecture, you can make it more relatable and engaging for everyone. It’s all about finding that common ground and emphasizing the universal beauty and significance. Let me know if you’d like any more ideas or support!"
