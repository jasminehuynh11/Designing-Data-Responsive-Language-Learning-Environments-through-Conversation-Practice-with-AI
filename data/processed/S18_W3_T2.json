It’s also possible they might try to contact you if there's any identifying info. In the meantime, it’s good to keep in touch with both the station and the police, and keep checking in periodically. Hopefully, it’ll turn up soon!"

The station or police station will guide you on the exact process. If you want, I can help you find the specific form or details for the location you’re dealing with. Just let me know!"

      "text": "It can vary depending on the location and the policies, but generally, train stations and police stations keep lost items for anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. After that period, if the items aren't claimed, they might be donated, auctioned, or disposed of. It’s always good to follow up regularly and stay in contact with them. If you want more precise info, I can definitely help with that too!"

      "text": "Updated saved memory Got it! In that case, it's a good idea to contact the lost and found departments in Melbourne as well, including the train stations and any places you visited, like restaurants or shops. You can also report it to the local police in Melbourne. The process is pretty similar, just make sure to provide as many details as possible. And definitely keep an eye on any updates.
