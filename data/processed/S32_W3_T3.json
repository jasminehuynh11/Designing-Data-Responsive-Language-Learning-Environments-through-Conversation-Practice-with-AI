    },

      "turn": 3,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Yes, I have a problem because today I want to do the laundry, but I have a leak in the washing machine and just start leaking water when I put the clothes on, so I don't know what I am supposed to do now.”"
    },
    {
      "turn": 4,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Oh, I’m sorry to hear that! That definitely sounds frustrating. No worries, I’ll help you out. Could you let me know the exact model of the washing machine and where the leak seems to be coming from? That'll help me figure out the next steps."
    },
    {
      "turn": 5,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Yes, the washing machine is LG, I think, but I don't know exactly the model because I'm here and I rent this property, so I don't know exactly what is the model of the washing machine.”"

      "turn": 6,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "No problem at all! That’s totally understandable. If you can describe where the leak is coming from—like if it’s from the door seal or underneath the machine—that would help. Also, let me know if you’ve tried any quick fixes so far."
    },

      "turn": 7,

      "turn": 8,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Got it, that makes sense! It’s great that you turned off the water. That definitely helps prevent any further leakage. What I can do is arrange for a maintenance technician to come by and take a look. Could you let me know when would be a good time for someone to visit?"
    },

      "speaker": "learner",

      "turn": 14,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "In that case, it might be best to keep the water turned off until the technician arrives, just to be safe. If you absolutely need water for other purposes, you could temporarily use a different source or make sure to keep an eye on the machine. And of course, we’ll get it all sorted out tomorrow. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!"
