And because he sadly passed away at the age of 46 from the bowel cancer, and he's the shocking many in the performing arts community. And I think this is the best way for the beginning. And then it can remind anyone that disease can affect anyone, no matter how healthy, active, or successful they appear to be. What do you think?"

Did you think in the end, when Maggie's speech, after Maggie's speech, then we can, in conclusion together, talk about bowel cancers, the theory, how serious they are, and then, and our robots can, hope our robots decide can fix this problem. What do you think?"

And as we talked about before, the robots had the different skill where he had X eyes and his right hand can turn into the treatment. And I've just forgot a lot of other parts. Please just remind Maggie to have more idea about the robots. And before Maggie's speech, we must know more about the robot's design details. Because Maggie promised us that he do the robot design part."
