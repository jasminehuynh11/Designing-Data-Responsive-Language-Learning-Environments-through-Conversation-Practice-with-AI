      "turn": 11,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "I don't agree with you about the exposure of water. I remembered when I bought my cell phone, the salesperson said me this kind of cell phone is a proof of water. By the way, I'm trying to charge with different chargers with my charger bought in your shop, and other chargers, like iPhone, huawei and others brands. But nothing happen"

      "turn": 12,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Alright, I understand — the S23 Ultra is water-resistant, so light rain normally shouldn’t kill it. Good to know you already tried several chargers. One more quick check: when you hold Power + Volume Down together for about 15–20 seconds, does the phone vibrate or show anything on the screen?"

    {
      "turn": 17,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "Unfortunately, I didn't have. But I checked in your website about what is the policy of guaranteen, and the guarantee is possible whenever every shop of Samsung around the world can get me a support."

      "turn": 18,
      "speaker": "bot",

      "turn": 19,

      "text": "Alright, I get it — you need the phone back quickly. Usually the first email from the service team arrives within 1–2 business days, and repairs themselves often take 3–5 days, depending on parts and diagnosis. By the way, you didn’t tell me your preferred time of day for receiving the service email — mornings or afternoons work better for you?"
