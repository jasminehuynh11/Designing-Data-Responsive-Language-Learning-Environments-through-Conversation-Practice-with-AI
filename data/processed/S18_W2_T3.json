      "text": "I couldn’t find the exact details on the price or facilities right now, but generally, you can always reach out to the landlord for that info. As for pets, in New South Wales, tenants can request to have pets, and landlords have to respond within 21 days. They can only refuse for certain reasons, like the pet not being suitable for the property. Let me know if you need more help!"

It's always a good idea to check with the auction house or the real estate agent for their specific requirements. If you need help with that, just let me know!"

These usually include a photo ID, like a driver's license or passport, proof of income (such as recent pay slips or bank statements), references from previous landlords, and sometimes a rental application form itself. It’s also good to have any additional documents that show your rental history or employment details. If you need more specifics, I’m happy to help!"

Some landlords or agencies can respond even sooner, especially if the property is in high demand. It’s always good to follow up after a few days if you haven’t heard anything. Let me know if you have any other questions!"

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Typically, the decision can be made anywhere from a couple of days to about a week after the application deadline, depending on how many applicants there are and how quickly the landlord or agent reviews everything. If there's a competitive market, it might take a bit longer. But usually, they'll let you know once a decision is reached. If you need more details, I'm here to help!"

      "turn": 16,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, you can apply for multiple apartments at the same time. Just keep in mind that you’ll want to be transparent with each landlord or agent about your situation. It’s also a good idea to keep track of the timelines and any responses you get. And of course, if you do get approved for multiple places, you can choose the one that suits you best. If you have any more questions, just let me know!"

For example, Rent.com.au has a studio in Potts Point for about $490 per week, and Homely.com.au lists another studio in Paddington for around $450 per week. Availability can change quickly, so it’s best to reach out directly for the latest details. Let me know if you need more info!"

      "turn": 20,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That can definitely depend on the landlord or the agent’s criteria, but generally, they’ll look at factors like your rental history, your income, references, and sometimes even your readiness to move in quickly. Some landlords might prioritize stable employment or a higher rental offer, while others might consider things like the length of the lease. It’s always a bit of a mix, and it can vary from one property to another. If you need more guidance, just let me know!"

      "turn": 22,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, you can definitely start the application process now and then provide the rental history documents later. Often, landlords or agents are flexible, especially if you're new to Australia. You can let them know your situation and offer alternative references, like an employer reference or personal references. Just keep communication open, and they’ll likely work with you. If you need help with that, I'm here!"

    },
    {
      "turn": 24,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Yes, that's totally fine. Most landlords and agents will accept a scanned copy or a clear photo of your ID via email. Just make sure you’re sending it securely and to the correct contact. And of course, it’s always good to follow up to confirm they received everything. If you have any concerns about privacy, let me know!"

    {
      "turn": 26,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Typically, the bond is paid before you move in, but often after you've signed the lease agreement. It’s usually one of the final steps before you get the keys. The bond is held by the relevant authority, like the Rental Bond Board, and it’s refundable at the end of the tenancy if everything’s in good condition. If you need more details, just let me know!"

      "turn": 28,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Yes, absolutely! You’ll typically receive the written tenancy agreement before you make any payments. It’s important to review all the terms and conditions thoroughly before you pay the bond or the first rent. This way, you’ll know exactly what you’re agreeing to. If you have any concerns or need clarification on any part of the agreement, you can definitely ask before finalizing anything."
