Learning objectives: • Use language for turn-taking and respectful disagreement. • Practise suggesting and clarifying ideas. • Use polite negotiation strategies. • (Advanced option) Engage in more complex group scenarios involving accountability, follow-up planning, and conflict resolution."

Responding to Feedback or a Performance Review Scenario: You are participating in a feedback session with a teacher, manager, or supervisor.

You can choose situations from the examples below; begin with a basic response and gradually try a more complex interaction by asking about development goals, long- term expectations, or feedback from previous tasks. Learning objectives: • Use active listening strategies. • Respond respectfully and constructively. • Ask follow-up questions about performance and goals. • (Advanced option) Participate in extended reflection and goal-setting based on feedback."
