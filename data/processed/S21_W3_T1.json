You need to describe the problem, ask for assistance, and check when the issue will be fixed. Practise speaking clearly and politely in a service setting. You will need to define the chatbot’s role as a housing manager or Internet support staff. You can choose situations from the examples below; start with a simple report and try a more detailed interaction by asking about troubleshooting steps, technician availability, or service timelines. Learning objectives: • Use and ask about specific vocabulary for technical problems (e.g., router, connection, or outage). • Practise sequencing (e.g., when it happened and what you tried). • Use polite and persistent questioning to request assistance. • (Advanced option) Manage extended service interactions by troubleshooting the issue, confirming steps, and negotiating next actions."
