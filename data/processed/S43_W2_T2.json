Typically, the standard savings account might have an interest rate of around 0.5% to 1%, while the higher interest account could range from about 1.5% to 2.5%, depending on the bank’s current offers.

It’s all about finding what works best for you and your budget. And if you ever want to switch in the future, we can always revisit it.
