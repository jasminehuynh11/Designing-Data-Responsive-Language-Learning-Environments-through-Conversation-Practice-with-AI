      "turn": 6,
      "speaker": "learner",

    },

      "turn": 7,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Sure, let me check that for you. Since you bought it online and it’s within 30 days, we can either offer a full refund or send a replacement if the item is faulty. Would you prefer to get a new bag or just have the handle repaired?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "I use it for my business and it's my favorite, so please give me a new same bag. I will ask you a question. I have already taken off the tags, is it no problem?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "No worries — since the damage is a quality issue, the missing tags won’t be a problem. We just need the receipt, which you already have. Could I confirm your order number so I can start the replacement request for you?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 10,

Is there anything else I can help you with today, maybe another item or a question about care instructions for your new bag?"
