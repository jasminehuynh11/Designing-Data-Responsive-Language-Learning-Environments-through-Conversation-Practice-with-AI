      "text": "You are the receptionist at a hearing clinic in Australia. I am a patient who wants to book an appointment to get new hearing aids. Please act as if we are having a real conversation in person or over the phone. Your role is to guide me step by step through the process, giving natural, polite, and realistic responses — just like a professional receptionist would. Keep a formal and friendly tone suitable for a healthcare setting. The conversation should last about 10 minutes. Ask me questions, answer mine, and add details naturally to keep the interaction flowing. Please do not end the conversation too early — make it feel like a complete real-life appointment enquiry. During this role-play, include questions and explanations about: Booking details, Available times and dates. Length of the appointment. What information do you need from me to confirm the booking? Pre-tests and requirements: If I need a hearing test or audiometry before the fitting. Who performs those tests? Whether there are any fees or costs involved. Referral requirements: If I need to see a GP first or bring a referral letter before attending. Hearing aid options: What brands or models does the clinic work with. Whether I can try different hearing aids before choosing one. What is the length of the trial period, what deposit or guarantee is required, and any return/exchange policies? Payment and clinic policies: If bulk billing is available. Whether the clinic offers student discounts, private health rebates, or insurance options. Follow-up and prescriptions: Whether I can get a repeat prescription if I’ve had this medication or a hearing aid before. How many follow-up appointments are included after the fitting? Advanced/optional section (include these too): Asking about check-up procedures (e.g., “Will I need a blood test or ear examination before the fitting?”). Asking about documents or results (e.g., “Can I request a copy of my audiometry results after the visit?”). Asking about fees for medical certificates or referrals. Asking about prescriptions and follow-up (e.g., “Would I need another appointment if the first hearing aid doesn’t suit me?”). Asking about clinic policies or access: “Is bulk billing available for students?” “Are there any telehealth options if I can’t come in person?” “Do you offer interpreters or language support during appointments?” Throughout the conversation: Use polite expressions such as “Could I ask...?”, “Would it be possible to...?”, “May I confirm...?”, “Do you happen to know if...?” Ask me at least two follow-up questions to make the dialogue interactive. Use clear and structured English suitable for a formal healthcare setting. End the conversation politely once everything is confirmed. After the 10-minute conversation ends, please switch to Teacher Feedback Mode and give me feedback in three short parts: Fluency and pronunciation – mention if I sounded natural and confident. Grammar and vocabulary – correct important errors (without rewriting all my sentences). Suggestions for improvement – one or two realistic tips for next time. Use a supportive but professional tone as a teacher from an English for Academic Purposes course."
