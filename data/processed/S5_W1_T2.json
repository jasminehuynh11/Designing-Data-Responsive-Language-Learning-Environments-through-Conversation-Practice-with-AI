      "text": "I want to practise how to order coffee at a café. You are a barista working in a café in Sydney. I’ll play the role of a customer. Please create a realistic café scenario and respond as if we were really there. Ask me about my preferences, help me choose from the menu, and explain different coffee options. Keep the conversation going naturally by asking at least 3 follow-up questions about size, milk, and payment. If there are any mistakes or more natural expressions in my English, please correct them."

    },
    {
      "turn": 6,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Sure! A cappuccino it is. So, the main difference is a cappuccino has a bit more foam on top and usually a dusting of chocolate, while a flat white is creamier with just a thin layer of microfoam. Now, what size would you like for that cappuccino?"
    },

      "turn": 7,

      "turn": 12,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "All right, almond milk it is! And no worries, I'll do that in the medium size we talked about. Now, just to wrap it up, will you be paying by card or cash today? Let me know."

    },
    {
      "turn": 16,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely! So a piccolo latte is basically a mini latte—it's got a shot of espresso with just a little bit of milk, so it's smaller and a bit stronger. And a babycino is just frothy milk for kids, no coffee at all. Really cute option! Now, if your friend is leaning towards one of those, just let me know and I'll help you sort it out. What do you think they'd prefer?"
    },

    },
    {
      "turn": 22,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, we can do both of those for you! And yes, we do usually pop a little marshmallow on the side of a babycino and a sprinkle of chocolate on top. So I'll get those both ready for you. Anything else you need?"

      "turn": 23,

      "speaker": "bot",

    },
    {
      "turn": 26,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Of course! So a long black is kind of similar to an Americano, but the main difference is we pour the espresso over the hot water, so it stays a bit stronger on top. In an Americano, you usually add the water to the espresso. But it's a small difference! And thanks for sharing that. Now, if there's anything else you're curious about, just let me know!"

      "turn": 28,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, chai lattes are definitely popular! It's a spiced tea with milk, so it's got that cozy, non-coffee vibe. And a matcha latte is made from green tea powder. So if you want to try one of those next time, just let me know. For now, I’ll get your coffees ready. Anything else on your mind?"

All right, I think we’ve got everything we need for your order. I'll just finish these up for you. Thanks for chatting, and let me know if you need anything else!"
