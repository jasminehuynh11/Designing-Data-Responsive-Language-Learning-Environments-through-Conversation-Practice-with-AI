    },
    {
      "turn": 15,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Yes, exactly — you’ll need to show some form of ID when collecting it, just to confirm it’s yours. And yes, we’ll call you as soon as we get any information. By the way, do you remember if there was any cash or other personal item in the wallet besides the cards?"
    },

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Alright, that’s noted. We’ll log your report right away and contact DALL restaurant to check their lost-and-found. Do you want us to block or notify your bank about the cards, or have you already done that?"

      "turn": 18,
