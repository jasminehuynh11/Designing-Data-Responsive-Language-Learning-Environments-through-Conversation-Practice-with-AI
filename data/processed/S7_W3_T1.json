    },

      "turn": 12,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "No, that color isn't right. Could you send me some technicians available?"

      "turn": 13,

    },
    {
      "turn": 15,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Good question! Before we send someone, let’s try a quick step. Could you unplug your router from the power for about 30 seconds, then plug it back in and see if the lights change?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 16,
      "speaker": "learner",

    },
    {
      "turn": 20,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "If you send someone today, I prefer afternoon because I have to work right now. And if you send someone to me tomorrow, I'm available both morning and afternoon."
    },
    {
      "turn": 21,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Got it, thanks. I’ll check availability for this afternoon first, and if no one’s free, we’ll schedule you for tomorrow. Would you like the technician to call before they arrive?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 22,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "Yes, please. So now, could I, should I just be staying at home?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 23,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Good question. You don’t need to wait yet — once your appointment is confirmed, we’ll text or call you with the time window. Will you be the one at home when the technician comes, or should we note another contact person?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 24,
      "speaker": "learner",

    },

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Perfect, thank you. I’ve noted that you’ll be available. Before I confirm, could you please tell me which service plan you’re using with us? It helps us match the right technician."

      "turn": 27,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Ah, you mean the individual home plan — great, that helps. Alright, I’ve got everything I need to schedule your visit. Would you like me to confirm the exact time by text or phone call?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 28,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "Please text me later. Okay, that's all. I'll be waiting for your message. Thank you. Thank you for your help."
