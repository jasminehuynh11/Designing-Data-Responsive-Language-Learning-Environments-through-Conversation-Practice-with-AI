If you want even less milk, we can do a smaller size or even a long black with just a splash. Now, let me know what you reckon and if you’re keen on anything to eat alongside your coffee. What's your pick?"

Now, on the food side, we've got some pretty tasty pastries and a few brekkie options. Maybe a croissant or a banana bread to go with it? Or if you’re feeling like something more, just let me know what you’re hungry for. What do you think you'd like to munch on?"

      "text": "Sure thing! So a flat white is usually in a medium-sized cup, not too big and not too tiny, just a nice balanced size. Now that you know that, how about we lock that in and maybe pick a little treat to go with it? We've got a few fresh pastries or even some avo toast if you’re feeling a bit fancy. What do you think?"
