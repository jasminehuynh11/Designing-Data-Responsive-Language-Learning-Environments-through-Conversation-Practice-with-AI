I want to do a master's degree in IT and I need your advice if I stay in the correct way. If I do a chemistry course, an IELTS course just for training, or if I do a PhD, what would advise me for my plan to study English with my dreams to do a master's degree?”"

Now, let me ask you: do you have any specific universities or countries in mind for your master’s, or are you still open to exploring that?"

So maybe we can lay out a study schedule that mixes your English practice with a bit of IT prep. Now, do you have a target date for when you’d like to start your master’s, so we can work backwards from there?"

Now, do you feel like you need any specific resources or guidance on what to study each week?"

    {
      "turn": 17,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, that makes sense. So with a full year ahead, I'd say if UTS prefers IELTS for admission, it's probably best to focus on that. So you could do general English first and then transition into some IELTS-specific prep as you get closer. Now, does that sound like a plan that would work for you?"

If I don't work full day, it's almost impossible. So, in the moment, I have work in companies as a laborer, in construction, as my staff is in big events. What you could advise me about it?”"

      "turn": 19,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, that’s a really practical concern. So if you need to juggle work and study, I’d say it’s totally fine to keep doing part-time jobs like barista or event work that fit around your schedule. That way you can earn while you improve your English and work toward your master’s goal. And over time, as your English gets stronger, you might find some small IT internships or part-time roles that can fit in. So does that sound like a workable balance for you?"
