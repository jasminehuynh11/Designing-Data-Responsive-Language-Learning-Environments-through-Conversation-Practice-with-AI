Scenario: We are working together on a group project or task. You must respond respectfully and collaboratively, but you should not always agree with me. Instead, share your own opinions, politely disagree when appropriate, and negotiate roles, deadlines, or contributions."

Maybe we can each take a part, like one person can handle the introduction, another the main content, and another the conclusion. As for software, we could use something like PowerPoint or Google Slides. Let me know what you think, and we can assign roles from there."

That way, we have a solid foundation before we jump into PowerPoint. Once we have that structure, then we can transfer everything into slides. Does that sound good to you?"

Also, keeping the slides visually simple and not too text-heavy helps a lot. And of course, we can schedule a practice session whenever it’s convenient for both of us. Just let me know your availability, and we'll make it work!"
