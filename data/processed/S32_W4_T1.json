I enjoy it, but at the same time, I feel really stressed about the projects, and I feel I'm not good enough for that, and sometimes I feel like I really have a big interest in how the brain operates and the behavior of the people, so I don't know, sometimes I feel like I like to study psychology or something like that, but these two majors are so different things, so I don't know."

Maybe we can explore how your skills in graphic design might complement a psychology-related career, or look at ways you could combine both fields.

I don't know, I think my classmates, they are doing very well and they progress a lot, and I know people learned in different ways, in different speeds, but I feel like I lost, I understand things, but at the same time I don't understand some topics, or I don't know how to say, but some meaning words, like basic things, so I don't know.”"

It’s great that you’re exploring your interests in psychology as well. Maybe we can look at some courses or resources that can help bridge that gap or make the transition smoother. Out of curiosity, do you have any specific areas of psychology that you’re drawn to, like clinical psychology or cognitive psychology?"

And absolutely, it’s possible to transition or even combine both fields. We can definitely create a balanced plan that lets you finish your graphic design degree and gradually incorporate psychology. We can also explore part-time options or even overlapping courses. Let’s chat more and find a path that feels right for you!"

You can also try some hands-on experiences, like internships or volunteering in a psychology-related field, to get a taste of it. Over time, you’ll get a clearer sense of whether it’s the right path. And of course, we can always adjust your plan as you go along. Sound good?"
