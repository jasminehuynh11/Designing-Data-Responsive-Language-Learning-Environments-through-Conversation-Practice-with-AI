To start, maybe you can let me know what your main idea or your perspective is on the project, and then we can go from there. Sound good?"

And when we have what kind of app, we can decide what is the target, how can look the app, the interface of the app, and all these kind of things. So first, I want to know if someone of you have an idea or what app we can create or something like that.”"

      "turn": 4,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That sounds like a great approach! I totally agree that we need to define the type of app first. I’ve been thinking about maybe a productivity app, but I’m curious if you or our other teammate have any specific ideas in mind. So, what kind of app were you envisioning?"

      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, I think that’s a fantastic idea! A productivity app for students could definitely meet a real need. We could focus on features like task management, scheduling, and reminders. So, do you have any specific features or functionalities in mind that you’d like to include?"

    {
      "turn": 7,

    {
      "turn": 8,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "That’s a great point! Narrowing down the target audience definitely helps. We could focus on university students, since they often juggle a lot of tasks and deadlines. But we could also consider high school students if we want to keep it broader. What do you think would be more beneficial or more interesting for our project?"
    },
    {
      "turn": 9,
      "speaker": "learner",
      "text": "“Okay, I agree. Definitely, we can choose university students. So, now that we decide what type of app we want to create, maybe the target that is the app, we have to decide what person do the research about the target, why it's a good idea, like the investigation, the research about that, and maybe the other person is focused to create a presentation, and the other person is the person who finds examples that exist in the market, or I don't know.”"

    {
      "turn": 10,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "Absolutely, that makes perfect sense! We can definitely divide the responsibilities that way. One person can focus on market research and understanding our target audience in depth, another can work on creating a compelling presentation to showcase our ideas, and the third person can look at existing apps in the market for inspiration. So, does that sound like a good plan for how we can divide the tasks?"

      "text": "“I don't know if something is missing. Do you think that we have to do another thing? Because I think the presentation is important and we need a good design for the presentation, but we can focus on that in the last part of the project if we have all the information before. So I think we can do together the presentation, but I don't know if you agree with that or someone wants to do by themselves the presentation or not.”"

    {
      "turn": 12,
      "speaker": "bot",
      "text": "I completely agree! It definitely makes sense to gather all the information first before we dive into the presentation design. And I’m totally open to collaborating on that final part together. That way, we can ensure consistency and a really polished final result. So, I think we’re definitely on the same page! Let me know if you have any other ideas or if you want to add anything else."

      "turn": 14,

Giving two weeks for research definitely allows us to gather everything thoroughly, and then having the next two weeks for the presentation and design is perfect. That way, we have a nice buffer for revisions and final touches. I think it’s a great timeline, and it should keep us on track and stress-free. Let me know if you want to adjust anything, but I think we’re good to go!"
