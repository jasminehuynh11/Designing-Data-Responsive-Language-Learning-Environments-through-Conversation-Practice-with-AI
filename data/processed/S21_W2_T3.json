Learning objectives: • Use polite, clear language when enquiring about rental properties. • Ask specific questions about availability, inspections, or applications. • Practise understanding and confirming important information. • Gain confidence communicating in housing-related situations. • (Advanced option) Handle more detailed rental enquiries by discussing application steps, document requirements, or follow-up actions. Instructions: Try to: • Ask about property details or inspection times. • Inquire about the application or rental process. • Confirm next steps or follow up on your application. • Finish the conversation politely and professionally. • (Advanced option) Use the extension prompts below to have a longer conversation. Examples of situations and prompts: 1. Asking about inspections • “Hi, I’m interested in the two-bedroom unit on Main Street.” • “Are there any inspection times this weekend?” • “Do I need to register before attending?” 2. Asking about the property • “Is the property furnished or unfurnished?” • “Are pets allowed?” • “How much is the bond?” 3. Clarifying the application process • “Can I apply online or do I need to visit the office?” • “What documents do I need to include with my application?” • “How long does it take to hear back?” 4. Following up on an application • “I submitted my application yesterday. Could you confirm if it was received?” • “Do you know when a decision will be made?” • “Should I provide any other documents?” 5. Finishing the conversation politely • “Thank you for the information.” • “I’ll attend the inspection on Saturday.”"
