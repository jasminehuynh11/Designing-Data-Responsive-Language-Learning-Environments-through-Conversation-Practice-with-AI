The bot initiated the repair by implicitly interpreting 'Pi' as 'pipe' and addressing the concern about future leaks and potential replacement in turn 21, successfully resolving the ambiguity."

The bot initiated the repair by implicitly correcting this lexical error to 'mold growth' in turn 23, demonstrating understanding and resolving the communication trouble."
