# Gemini API Setup

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The API key is stored in the `.env` file (which is gitignored for security).

## Testing the Connection

Run the test script to verify the API connection:

```bash
python test_gemini_connection.py
```

If successful, you should see a confirmation message with a response from the Gemini API.
